OBJECTIVES: To analyze the prognostic and risk factors related to surgical 
treatment of central spinal cord syndrome (CSS) and to find out the optimal 
timing of operative management.
METHODS: From January 2011 to January 2019, a consecutive series of 128 patients 
with CSS confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively 
analyzed including their clinical records and radiologic data from a 
prospectively maintained database in a single center.
RESULTS: According to the prognosis evaluated by the modified Japanese 
Orthopedic Association (mJOA), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor 
score (AMS), and ASIA impairment scale (AIS) grade, the overall postoperative 
outcome was good. Finally, it was found that surgical timing, presence of 
myelopathy or not at baseline, AMS at admission, and compression ratio were 
independent factors affecting the prognosis. Surgery as soon as possible after 
the occurrence of CSS is still advocated.
CONCLUSION: Cervical myelopathy at baseline, compression ratio, and AMS score on 
admission were independent prognostic factors for the surgical treatment of CSS. 
If surgical indications are clear, early surgical intervention should be 
actively considered.

PURPOSE: Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a progressive slow-motion spinal 
cord injury. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Baseline disability predicts 
surgical recovery; therefore, timely treatment is critical to restoring 
function. However, current challenges mean most patients present with advanced 
disease and are instead left with life changing disabilities. While short-term 
mortality is rarely reported, the long-term effects of this on life expectancy 
are unknown, including whether function could be modifiable with timely 
treatment. This article investigates the effect of DCM on life expectancy.
METHODS: The survival of patients from an observational study of patients 
undergoing surgery from 1994 to 2007 was compared to their expected survival 
using a gender- and aged -matched cohort. Comparisons were made by one sample 
log-rank test and standardised mortality ratios. Factors associated with 
survival were explored using a Cox regression analysis, including disease 
severity.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were included in the analysis. After a median 
follow-up of 15.3 years, 135 of 349 patients had died; 114.7 deaths would have 
been expected. The DCM cohort had an increased risk of death compared to the 
non-DCM cohort (standardised mortality ratio 1.18 [95% CI: 1.02-1.34]. Age at 
operation 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.1, p < 0.001) and severe DCM 1.6 (95% CI: 1.06 
to 2.3, p = 0.02) were associated with worse survival (N = 287). In those 
surviving at least 2 years after surgery, only severe DCM was associated with 
conditional survival (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.04 2.4, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is reduced in those undergoing surgery for DCM. This 
is driven by premature mortality among those left with severe disability. As 
disability can be reduced with timely treatment, these findings reinforce the 
need for collective and global action to raise awareness of DCM and enable early 
diagnosis.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with cervical kyphosis after 
laminoplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many factors are reportedly associated with the 
deterioration of cervical curvature after laminoplasty, including cervical 
lordosis angle, cervical spine range of motion (ROM), T1 slope, and C2-7 
sagittal vertical axis. Post-laminoplasty kyphosis or deterioration of cervical 
curvature is likely caused by multiple factors. There is currently no consensus 
on these issues.
METHODS: Data of patients treated with laminoplasty for degenerative cervical 
myelopathy at our institution during 2008-2018 were reviewed. The following 
variables were collected for each patient: age and sex; follow-up time; surgery 
involving C3 (yes or no); surgery involving C7 (yes or no); distribution of 
segments operated on; number of laminae operated on; flexion, extension, and 
total ROM; cervical lordotic angle; longitudinal distance index; curvature 
index; C2-7 sagittal vertical axis; and T1 slope. Logistic regression analysis 
was used to assess possible risk factors for postoperative kyphosis. Receiver 
operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the cut-off values 
of risk factors.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 151 patients. Logistic regression analysis 
indicated that sex, number of laminae operated on, and preoperative extension 
ROM were significantly associated with postoperative cervical kyphosis (P<0.05). 
There was significantly greater postoperative kyphosis in women than in men; the 
more segments operated on, the greater the risk of postoperative kyphosis, and 
the larger the preoperative extension ROM, the lower the risk of 
post-laminoplasty kyphosis. Receiver operating curve analysis showed that the 
cut-off value for preoperative extension ROM is 22.1°.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative extension ROM may be associated with the development of 
postoperative kyphosis. The cut-off value of preoperative extension ROM that 
suggested the prospect of postoperative kyphosis in our sample was 22.1°.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic spinal injuries are frequent and their management is 
debated, especially in major trauma patients. This study aims to describe a 
large population of major trauma patients with vertebral fractures to improve 
prevention measures and fracture management.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 6274 trauma patients 
prospectively collected between October 2010 and October 2020. Collected data 
include demographics, mechanism of trauma, type of imaging, fracture morphology, 
associated injuries, injury severity score (ISS), survival, and death timing. 
The statistical analysis focused on mechanism of trauma and the search of 
predictive factors for critical fractures.
RESULTS: Patients showed a mean age of 47 years and 72.5% were males. Trauma 
included 59.9% of road accidents and 35.1% of falls. 30.7% patients had at least 
a severe fracture, while 17.2% had fractures in multiple spinal regions. 13.7% 
fractures were complicated by spinal cord injury (SCI). The mean ISS of the 
total population was 26.4 (SD 16.3), with 70.7% patients having an ISS≥16. There 
is a higher rate of severe fractures in fall cases (40.1%) compared to RA (21.9% 
to 26.3%). The probability of a severe fracture increased by 164% in the case of 
fall and by 77% in presence of AIS≥3 associated injury of head/neck while 
reduced by 34% in presence of extremities associated injuries. Multiple level 
injuries increased with ISS rise and in the case of extremities associated 
injuries. The probability of a severe upper cervical fracture increased by 5.95 
times in the presence of facial associated injuries. The mean length of stay was 
24.7 days and 9.6% of patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, road accidents are still the most frequent trauma 
mechanism and cause more cervico-thoracic fractures, while falls cause more 
lumbar fractures. Spinal cord injuries represent an indicator of more severe 
trauma. In motorcyclists or fallers/jumpers, there is a higher risk of severe 
fractures. When a spinal injury is diagnosed, the probability of a second 
vertebral fracture is consistent. These data could help the decisional workflow 
in the management of major trauma patients with vertebral injury.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common secondary 
medical complication following spinal cord injury (SCI), significantly impacting 
health care resource utilization and costs.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize risk factors and health care utilization costs 
associated with UTIs in the setting of SCI.
METHODS: IBM's Marketscan Database from 2000-2019 was utilized to identify 
individuals with traumatic SCI. Relevant ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes classified 
individuals into two analysis groups: having ≥ 1 UTI episode or no UTI episodes 
within 2 years following injury. Demographics (age, sex), insurance type, 
comorbidities, level of injury (cervical, thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and health 
care utilization/payments were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 6762 individuals retained, 1860 had ≥ 1 UTI with an average of 
three episodes (SD 2). Younger age, female sex, thoracic level of injury, 
noncommercial insurance, and having at least one comorbidity were associated 
with increased odds of UTI. Individuals with a UTI in year 1 were 11 times more 
likely to experience a UTI in year 2. As expected, those with a UTI had a higher 
rate and associated cost of hospital admission, use of outpatient services, and 
prescription refills. UTIs were associated with 2.48 times higher cumulated 
health care resource use payments over 2 years after injury.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to bladder management-related causes, several factors 
are associated with an increased risk of UTIs following SCI. UTI incidence 
substantially increases health care utilization costs. An increased 
understanding of UTI-associated risk factors may improve the ability to identify 
and manage higher risk individuals with SCI and ultimately optimize their health 
care utilization.

OBJECTIVE: Return to work (RTW) is an important surgical outcome for patients 
who are employed, yet a significant number of patients with cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy (CSM) who are employed undergo cervical spine surgery and fail to 
RTW. In this study, the authors investigated factors associated with failure to 
RTW in the CSM population who underwent cervical spine surgery and who were 
considered to have a good surgical outcome yet failed to RTW.
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 
the cervical myelopathy module of a national spine registry, the Quality 
Outcomes Database. The CSM data set of the Quality Outcomes Database was queried 
for patients who were employed at the time of surgery and planned to RTW 
postoperatively. Distinct multivariable logistic regression models were fitted 
with 3-month RTW as an outcome for the overall population to identify risk 
factors for failure to RTW. Good outcomes were defined as patients who had no 
adverse events (readmissions or complications), who had achieved 30% improvement 
in Neck Disability Index score, and who were satisfied (North American Spine 
Society satisfaction score of 1 or 2) at 3 months postsurgery.
RESULTS: Of the 409 patients who underwent surgery, 80% (n = 327) did RTW at 3 
months after surgery. At 3 months, 56.9% of patients met the criteria for a good 
surgical outcome, and patients with a good outcome were more likely to RTW 
(88.1% vs 69.2%, p < 0.01). Of patients with a good outcome, 11.9% failed to RTW 
at 3 months. Risk factors for failing to RTW despite a good outcome included 
preoperative short-term disability or leave status (OR 3.03 [95% CI 1.66-7.90], 
p = 0.02); a higher baseline Neck Disability Index score (OR 1.41 [95% CI 
1.09-1.84], p < 0.01); and higher neck pain score at 3 months postoperatively 
(OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.66-0.99], p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with CSM who undergo spine surgery reenter the 
workforce within 3 months from surgery, with RTW rates being higher among 
patients who experience good outcomes. Among patients with good outcomes who 
were employed, failure to RTW was associated with being on preoperative 
short-term disability or leave status prior to surgery as well as higher neck 
pain scores at baseline and at 3 months postoperatively.

There is a growing need to discover the characteristics that predict prognostic 
factors after the first demyelinating event. In this study of 141 patients that 
met the 2017 McDonald criteria, a higher number of oligoclonal bands, cervical 
spinal cord demyelinating lesions, and sensory involvement were identified as 
independent predictors of the second demyelinating event during the 5-year 
follow-up period in patients who experienced the first demyelinating event. The 
identification of the aforementioned risk variables will make it possible to 
identify patients who are more likely to exhibit early second demyelinating 
event, implying more frequent monitoring and consideration of early application 
of highly effective disease-modifying treatment.

The objective of this study is to assess the change trends of perioperative 
esophageal area for anterior cervical corpectomy fusion (ACCF) and to analyze 
the risk factors of the area for postoperative dysphagia. We retrospectively 
analyzed 309 patients who underwent ACCF due to degenerative cervical diseases 
between November 2015 and September 2019 at our hospital. Patients were divided 
into 2 groups named the dysphagia group and the normal swallowing function 
group, according to the swallowing function after ACCF. The esophageal area was 
measured at T1 level using computed tomography axial plane images before and 
after surgery (1 week, 1 month, 8 months, and 12 months), in order to assess the 
change trends of esophageal area perioperatively and analyze risk factors of the 
area for dysphagia after ACCF. The area was highest at 1 week after surgery and 
would be decreased over time in both groups, which was recovered to the 
preoperative levels in 12 months after surgery. The incidence of dysphagia after 
ACCF was 41.1%. In the dysphagia group, 127 patients (mean age 59.299 years) had 
dysphagia after ACCF. In the normal-swallowing function group, 182 patients 
(mean age 59.8352 years) had normal swallowing function after ACCF. The 
preoperative esophageal area was larger in the dysphagia group than in the 
normal-swallowing function group. Preoperative esophageal area was correlated 
with postoperative dysphagia (odds ratio: 1.3457, 95% confidence interval: 
1.106-1.637). When the esophageal area at preoperation was above 3.388 cm2, the 
risk of postoperative dysphagia was higher. The esophageal area was the biggest 
at 1 week postoperatively, significantly decreased over time and would be 
recovered to the normal size at 12 months after surgery. Preoperative esophageal 
area should be considered when evaluating the risk factor for dysphagia after 
ACCF.

cord injury: a case report.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) has high incidence in traumatic spinal 
cord injured (tSCI) patients and can frequently be life-threatening, especially 
early post-injury. Several risk factors often compound bleeding risk, some are 
unique to this patient population. Normally, clinical suspicion for GIB arises 
from symptoms like coffee-ground emesis, hematemesis, melena or even 
hematochezia. A hemoglobin drop may be a late sign. Due to tSCI, however, 
patients often experience neurogenic bowels and dysautonomia, which may delay 
symptom presentation and complicate timely diagnosis of GIB. We report a case of 
an almost clinically silent GI bleed in the context of acute cervical tSCI.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old female presented with cervical cord transection 
at C-7 in the setting of motor vehicle rollover, for which surgical 
decompression was performed. During the acute injury phase, she also received a 
10-day course of dexamethasone for symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia. Two weeks 
after injury, she underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement 
which demonstrated normal gastric and duodenal anatomy. One week later, a large 
spike (10x) in blood urea nitrogen: creatinine (BUN: Cr) ratio raised concern 
for GIB, but hemoglobin remained stable, and stool color remained unchanged. The 
following day, a gastroenterology consult was requested under increased 
suspicion of GIB from a sudden 3.5 g/dL hemoglobin drop. The patient received 
blood transfusion and pantoprazole. An upper endoscopy was performed, revealing 
three small duodenal ulcers. Melanotic stool ensued afterwards.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to dysautonomia, clinical presentation of GIB can be 
significantly delayed in the tSCI patient population, leaving them vulnerable to 
succumb to illness. This case illustrates the possibility of an interval in 
which the patient was bleeding, with the sole indicator being an elevated BUN. 
Our case calls for closer monitoring of and vigilance for tSCI patients, and 
possibly employment of different strategies to reduce the incidence and enhance 
early detection of GIB in tSCI patients to subsequently decrease the morbidity 
and mortality associated with it.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical traumatic spinal cord injury (CTSCI) is a seriously 
disabling disease that severely affects the physical and mental health of 
patients and imposes a huge economic burden on patients and their families. 
Accurate identification of the prognosis of CTSCI patients helps clinicians to 
design individualized treatment plans for patients. For this purpose, a dynamic 
nomogram was developed to predict the recovery of CTSCI patients after 6 months.
METHODS: We retrospectively included 475 patients with CTSCI in our institution 
between March 2013 and January 2022. The outcome variable of the current study 
was a satisfactory recovery of patients with CTSCI at 6 months. Univariate 
analyses and univariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the 
factors affecting the prognosis of patients with CTSCI. Subsequently, variables 
(P < 0.05) were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis to 
evaluate these factors further. Eventually, a nomogram model was constructed 
according to these independent risk factors. The concordance index (C-index) and 
the calibration curve were utilized to assess the model's predictive ability. 
The discriminating capacity of the prediction model was measured by the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). One hundred nine 
patients were randomly selected from 475 patients to serve as the center's 
internal validation test cohort.
RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression model further screened out six 
independent factors that impact the recovery of patients with CTSCI. Including 
admission to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) 
grade, the length of high signal in the spinal cord, maximum spinal cord 
compression (MSCC), spinal segment fractured, admission time, and hormonal 
therapy within 8 h after injury. A nomogram prediction model was developed based 
on the six independent factors above. In the training cohort, the AUC of the 
nomogram that included these predictors was 0.879, while in the test cohort, it 
was 0.824. The nomogram C-index incorporating these predictors was 0.872 in the 
training cohort and 0.813 in the test cohort, while the calibration curves for 
both cohorts also indicated good consistency. Furthermore, this nomogram was 
converted into a Web-based calculator, which provided individual probabilities 
of recovery to be generated for individuals with CTSCI after 6 months and 
displayed in a graphical format.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram, including ASIA grade, the length of high signal in the 
spinal cord, MSCC, spinal segment fractured, admission time, and hormonal 
therapy within 8 h after injury, is a promising model to predict the probability 
of content recovery in patients with CTSCI. This nomogram assists clinicians in 
stratifying patients with CTSCI, enhancing evidence-based decision-making, and 
individualizing the most appropriate treatment.

PURPOSE: The pathology of dropped head syndrome (DHS) is diverse, and reports of 
surgery for DHS are scarce. We aimed to describe surgery for DHS and to 
investigate the surgical outcomes thereof.
METHODS: We enrolled 40 consecutive patients (six males and 34 females; average 
age at surgery, 72.0 years) with DHS who underwent correction surgeries at a 
single institute. Short fusion (SF), with the extent of fixation mainly at the 
cervical region, was performed for 27 patients; long fusion (LF), involving the 
cervical and thoracic spine, for 13. Clinical and radiological outcomes were 
investigated, and factors analyzed using the Japanese Orthopedic Association 
Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ).
RESULTS: All patients were able to gaze horizontally at the follow-up. Instances 
of five transient C5 palsy results, and five distal junctional kyphosis results 
were found, but no revisions were reported due to recurrence. Patients whose T1 
slope-20° was smaller than the C2-7 angle postoperatively exhibited better 
clinical outcomes in the three domains of the JOACMEQ, regardless of the extent 
of fixation.
CONCLUSION: For cases where the T1 slope is relatively small, and approximately 
10° of cervical lordosis is predicted to be obtained postoperatively, SF is 
appropriate. Alternatively, for cases with higher T1 slope, obtaining a cervical 
lordosis over 20° has a risk of postoperative complications. For such cases, it 
is an option to perform an LF involving the cervical and thoracic spine.

STUDY DESIGN: A Prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, etiology, and outcomes of patients who 
experience neurological deterioration after surgery for Degenerative Cervical 
Myelopathy (DCM).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Postoperative neurological deterioration is one of 
the most undesirable complications that can occur after surgery for DCM.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Canadian Spine Outcomes and Research Network 
DCM prospective cohort study. We defined postoperative neurological 
deterioration as any decrease in modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association 
(mJOA) score by at least one point from baseline to three months after surgery. 
Adverse events were collected using the Spinal Adverse Events Severity protocol. 
Secondary outcomes included patient-reported pain, disability, and 
health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: Among a study cohort of 428 patients, 50 (12%) deteriorated by at least 
one mJOA point after surgery for DCM (21 by one point, 15 by two points, and 14 
by three points or more). Significant risk factors included older age, female 
sex, and milder disease. Among those who deteriorated, 13 experienced 
contributing intraoperative or postoperative adverse events, six had alternative 
non-DCM diagnoses, and 31 did not have an identifiable reason for deterioration. 
Patients who deteriorated had significantly lower mJOA scores at one year after 
surgery [13.5 (SD 2.7) vs. 15.2 (SD 2.2), P <0.01 and those with larger 
deteriorations were less likely to recover their mJOA to at least their 
preoperative baseline, but most secondary measures of pain, disability, and 
health-related quality of life were unaffected.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of deterioration of mJOA scores after surgery for DCM 
was approximately one in 10, but some deteriorations were unrelated to actual 
spinal cord impairment and most secondary outcomes were unaffected. These 
findings can inform patient and surgeon expectations during shared 
decision-making, and they demonstrate that the interpretation of mJOA scores 
without clinical context can sometimes be misleading.

Pseudobulbar palsy and bulbar palsy cause dysphagia in patients with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). Dysphagia in patients with ALS not only increases the 
risk of aspiration and pneumonia but also leads to malnutrition and weight loss, 
which are poor prognostic factors. Gastrostomy is the preferred route of feeding 
and nutritional support in patients with dysphagia. However, there are no 
established standards to determine the ideal timing of gastrostomy for patients 
with ALS. Therefore, we used the videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS), which 
objectively quantifies swallowing function, in videofluoroscopic swallowing 
study (VFSS) to investigate whether this scale at diagnosis can be a useful 
predictor for the timing of gastrostomy. We retrospectively evaluated 22 
patients with ALS who were diagnosed at our hospital. We assessed the VDS scores 
in all patients within 3 months of diagnosis. A decline in the ALS functional 
rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R) scores was used as an indicator of disease 
progression. As a result, we found that the VDS score of the pharyngeal phase 
and the total VDS score were significantly correlated with the ΔALSFRS-R scores. 
These scores were also associated with the existing indicators for the timing of 
gastrostomy, i.e., decreased body weight and percent-predicted forced vital 
capacity. We demonstrated the noninferiority of the VDS scores relative to the 
existing indicators. In addition, the VDS score of the pharyngeal phase was 
significantly correlated with the time from diagnosis to gastrostomy. The VDS 
score could estimate the timing of gastrostomy in patients with ALS with 
dysphagia at diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the survival and medium to long term health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with primary cervical spinal tumors in a 
cross-sectional study and to identify any significant associations with 
demographic or clinical characteristics.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with primary cervical spinal tumors were 
retrospectively enrolled and their clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data 
(specifically the EQ-5D questionnaire) were collected. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox time-dependent regression analyses were performed to examine 
the significance of certain variables on overall survival. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify variables 
significant for overall HRQoL and each dimension of the EQ-5D.
RESULTS: A total of 341 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean 
follow-up of 70 months. The diagnosis was benign in 246 cases, malignant in 84, 
and unconfirmed in 11. The 5-year overall survival rate was 86% and the 10-year 
overall survival rate was 65%. Multivariate analysis suggested that surgical 
treatment (P = 0.002, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.431, 95% CI. [0.254, 0.729]), benign 
and malignant tumors [P < 0.001, HR = 2.788, 95% CI. (1.721, 4.516)], tumor and 
surrounding normal tissue boundary [P = 0.010, HR = 1.950, 95% CI. (1.171, 
3.249)], and spinal instability [P = 0.031, HR = 1.731, 95% CI. (1.051, 2.851)] 
still had significant effects on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the survival period and 
medium and long-term health-related quality of life of patients with primary 
tumors of the cervical spine, and analyzed the significant related factors of 
tumor clinical characteristics. Surgery, myelopathy, malignancy, spinal pain 
relieved by lying down or supine position, and tumor infiltration on MRI were 
significant predictors for overall survival. Enneking stage and age were 
significant predictors for HRQoL.

Background Cervical laminoplasty is a surgical alternative to laminectomy and 
fusion for treating multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy. There is 
limited evidence evaluating readmission incidence and risk factors following 
cervical laminoplasty. Here, we provide a retrospective review evaluating 
preoperative risk for 30-day readmission following cervical laminoplasty. 
Methodology The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was used to identify patients 
undergoing laminoplasty as defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 63050 
and 63051. Patients were then categorized based on whether 30-day readmission 
occurred, and preoperative risk factors were examined. Continuous and 
categorical variables were analyzed using Student's t-test or Fisher's exact 
test. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for each variable, with 
p-values of <0.05 considered significant. Results In total, 3,085 patients were 
identified as undergoing posterior cervical laminoplasty. Of these, 2,938 
patients did not require readmission, and 147 patients were readmitted, 
representing a 4.77% 30-day readmission rate. For all patients, sepsis (odds 
ratio (OR) = 5.58, p = 0.03), dialysis (OR = 3.46, p = 0.01), American Society 
of Anesthesiologists class >2 (OR = 1.69, p = 0.011), and hypertension (OR = 
1.51, p = 0.04) were predictive of readmission. A subgroup analysis was 
performed for all geriatric patients (aged >65). In total, 1,353 patients were 
identified, of whom 76 were readmitted, demonstrating a readmission rate of 
5.62%. For the elderly patients, hypertension (OR = 1.98, confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.04-3.75, p = 0.04) and independent status (OR = 0.39, CI = 0.21-0.74, p 
= 0.004) were predictive of readmission. Conclusions Assessment of predictors 
for readmission is important for patient education and setting appropriate 
clinical expectations for surgeons and providers. Preoperative hypertension, 
dialysis, and sepsis were risk factors for 30-day readmission following cervical 
laminoplasty, with functional status being a unique risk factor for elderly 
patients.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: To report a new index, the realigned K-line, for predicting surgical 
outcomes after laminoplasty in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy 
(DCM).
METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients with DCM undergoing laminoplasty were 
enrolled from January 2018 to April 2021 in our department. A realigned K-line 
was defined as the line connecting the midpoints of the spinal cord between C2 
and C7 on realigned T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The minimum interval 
between the anterior compression factors of the spinal cord and the realigned 
K-line (INTrea), and the modified K-line (INTmod) were measured. A logistic 
regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with 
unsatisfactory surgical outcomes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was applied to evaluate the reliability 
of the multivariate logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the score for the bladder function 
section of the Japanese Orthopedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation 
Questionnaire, numeric rating scale scores for arm pain, and INTrea might be 
related to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) recovery rate (RR) not 
achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (P < .05). Only 
INTrea (odds ratio = .744, P < .05) was an independent preoperative factor 
related to the JOA RR not achieving the MCID (area under the curve, .743). A 
cutoff of 5.0 mm for INTrea had an accuracy of 71.9% and specificity of 80.3% 
for predicting the JOA RR not achieving the MCID.
CONCLUSIONS: INTrea is an independent preoperative risk factor related to the 
JOA RR not achieving the MCID in patients with DCM. A cutoff point of 5.0 mm is 
most appropriate for alerting spine surgeons to a high likelihood of the JOA RR 
not achieving the MCID.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship 
between predictors and the time of tracheostomy after traumatic cervical spinal 
cord injury (TCSCI).
METHODS: Five hundred twenty-six patients with TCSCI treated between 
January,2012 and December, 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were 
subdivided into two groups: early tracheostomy (≤7 days from initiation of 
endotracheal intubation) and late tracheostomy. Comparisons between early 
tracheostomy and late tracheostomy were statistically analyzed. Logistic 
regression analysis was applied to identify independent predictors of 
tracheostomy and calculate probability for different grades of combining 
predictors to predict tracheostomy. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used 
to evaluate the association between the grade of combining predictors and the 
time to tracheostomy.
RESULTS: Among 526 eligible patients, 63(12.0%) had a tracheostomy performed. 
Compared with late tracheostomy group, patients in early tracheostomy group had 
higher ISS, more severe neurological status while fewer In-hospital LOS days and 
ICU LOS days. By Logistic regression analysis, severe American Spinal Injury 
Association Impairment Scale (AIS A), the neurological level of injury (NLI>C5), 
higher Injury Severity Score (ISS>16) and advanced age (over 50 years old) were 
identified as independent predictors for tracheostomy. Depending on the 
likelihood of tracheostomy, the combining predictors were graded into five 
categories. As the value of probability was higher than 50%, Grade I-III made 
optimistic predictions about tracheostomy. According to Spearman's correlation 
analysis, early tracheostomy had a strong association with Grade I, while late 
tracheostomy was closely correlated with Grade III.
CONCLUSIONS: Factors related to the decision of tracheostomy were ASIA 
impairment scale, neurological level of injury, injury severity score and age. 
The grades of combining predictors could support indication for predicting the 
time of tracheostomy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate trends in the utilization of intraoperative 
neuromonitoring (IONM) during anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) 
procedures in NY state using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative 
System and to determine if utilization of IONM resulted in a reduction in 
postoperative neurological deficits.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: IONM has been available to spinal surgeons for 
several decades. It has become increasingly prevalent in all facets of spinal 
surgery including elective ACDF procedures. The utility of IONM for preventing a 
neurological deficit in elective spine procedures has recently been called into 
question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System 
database were accessed to perform a retrospective cohort study comparing 
monitored versus unmonitored ACDF procedures between 2007 and 2018 as defined by 
the International Classification of Disease-9 and 10 Procedural Coding System 
(ICD-9 PCS, ICD-10 PCS) codes. Patient demographics, medical history, surgical 
intervention, pertinent in-hospital events, and urban versus rural medical 
centers (as defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget) were 
recorded. Propensity-score-matched comparisons were used to identify factors 
related to the utilization of IONM and risk factors for neurological deficits 
after elective ACDF.
RESULTS: A total of 70,838 [15,092 monitored (21.3%) and 55,746 (78.7%) 
unmonitored] patients' data were extracted. The utilization of IONM since 2007 
has increased in a linear manner from 0.9% of cases in 2007 to 36.7% by 2018. 
Overall, baseline characteristics of patients who were monitored during cases 
differed significantly from unmonitored patients in age, race/ethnicity, 
insurance type, presence of myelopathy or radiculopathy, and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index; however, only race/ethnicity was statistically significant 
when analyzed using propensity-score-matched. When comparing urban and rural 
medical centers, there is a significant lag in the adoption of the technology 
with no monitored cases in rural centers until 2012 with significant 
fluctuations in utilization compared with steadily increasing utilization among 
urban centers. From 2017 to 2018, reporting of neurological deficits after 
surgery resembled literature-established norms. Pooled analysis of these years 
revealed that the incidence of neurological complications occurred more 
frequently in monitored cases than in unmonitored (3.0% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The utility of IONM for elective ACDF remains uncertain; however, 
it continues to gain popularity for routine cases. For medical centers that lack 
similar resources to centers in more densely populated regions of NY state, 
reliable access to this technology is not a certainty. In our analysis of 
intraoperative neurological complications, it seems that IONM is not protective 
against neurological injury.

Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a severe disease characterized by excessive 
release of inflammatory cytokines caused by abnormal activation of lymphocytes 
and macrophages, which can cause multiple organ damage and even death. 
Panniculitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of subcutaneous adipose 
tissue. We effectively treated 2 patients with panniculitis-associated HPS with 
ruxolitinib. Case 1: A 70-year-old male started with intermittent plantar 
swelling and pain, and then developed leukocytosis, mild anemia, multiple red 
maculopapules with painless subcutaneous nodules on the forehead, neck and 
bilateral lower legs. The patient was treated with prednisone and leflunomide 
for improvement. After that, repeated fever and rash occurred again. After 
admission to our hospital, we found his leukocyte and hemoglobin decreased, 
ferritin raised, fibrinogen and natural killer (NK) cell activity decreased, and 
hemophagocytic cells were found in bone marrow aspiration. The skin pathology 
was consistent with non-suppurative nodular panniculitis. He was diagnosed with 
nodular panniculitis associa-ted HPS. He was treated with glucocorticoid, 
cyclosporine, etoposide and gamma globule, but the disease was not completely 
controlled. After adjusting etoposide to ruxolitinib, his symptoms and abnormal 
laboratory findings returned to normal. After 2 months he stopped using 
ruxolitinib due to repeated infections. During the follow-up, though the 
prednisone dose was tapered, his condition was stable. Case 2: A 46-year-old 
female patient developed from intermittent fever, erythematous nodular rash with 
tenderness, leukopenia, and abnormal liver function. antibiotic therapy was 
ineffective. She improved after glucocorticoid treatment, and relapsed after 
glucocorticoid reduction. There were fever, limb nodules, erythema with 
ulcerative necrosis, intermittent abdominal pain when she came to our hospital. 
Blood examination showed that her white blood cells, red blood cells and 
platelets were decreased, fibrinogen was decreased, triglyceride was increased, 
ferritin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor(SIL-2R/sCD25) were significantly 
raised, and hemophagocytic cells were found in bone marrow aspiration. It was 
found that Epstein-Barr virus DNA was transiently positive, skin Staphylococcus 
aureus infection, and pulmonary Aspergillus flavus infection, but C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were normal, and no 
evidence of tumor and other infection was found. Skin pathology was considered 
panniculitis. The diagnosis was panniculitis, HPS and complicated infection. 
Antibiotic therapy and symptomatic blood transfusion were given first, but the 
disease was not controlled. Later, dexamethasone was given, and the condition 
improved, but the disease recurred after reducing the dose of dexamethasone. Due 
to the combination of multiple infections, the application of etoposide had a 
high risk of infection spread. Ruxolitinib, dexamethasone, and anti-infective 
therapy were given, and her condition remained stable after dexamethasone 
withdrawal. After 2 months of medication, she stopped using ruxolitinib. One 
week after stopping using ruxolitinib, she developed fever and died after 2 
weeks of antibiotic therapy treatment in a local hospital. In conclusion, 
panniculitis and HPS are related in etiology, pathogenic mechanism and clinical 
manifestations. Abnormal activation of Janus-kinase and signal transduction 
activator of transcription pathway and abnormal release of inflammatory factors 
play an important role in the pathogenesis of the two diseases. The report 
suggests that ruxolitinib is effective and has broad prospects in the treatment 
of panniculitis associated HPS.

Arteriolosclerosis is common in older brains and related to cognitive and motor 
impairment. We compared the severity of arteriolosclerosis and its associations 
with cerebrovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) in multiple locations in the 
brain and spinal cord. Participants (n = 390) were recruited in the context of a 
longitudinal community-based clinical-pathological study, the Rush Memory and 
Aging Project. CVD-RFs were assessed annually for an average of 8.7 (SD = 4.3) 
years before death. The annual assessments included systolic (SBP) and diastolic 
(DBP) blood pressure, diabetes mellitus (DM), low- and high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and smoking. Postmortem pathological 
assessments included assessment of arteriolosclerosis severity using the same 
rating scale in three brain locations (basal ganglia, frontal, and parietal 
white matter regions) and four spinal cord levels (cervical, thoracic, lumbar 
and sacral levels). A single measure was used to summarize the severity of 
spinal arteriolosclerosis assessments at the four levels due to their high 
correlations. Average age at death was 91.5 (SD = 6.2) years, and 73% were 
women. Half showed arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter and spinal cord 
followed by parietal white matter (38%) and basal ganglia (27%). The severity of 
arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations showed mild-to-moderate 
correlations. By contrast, spinal arteriolosclerosis was associated with brain 
arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Higher DBP was associated with 
more severe arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations. DM was associated 
with more severe arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Controlling 
for DBP, higher SBP was inversely associated with arteriolosclerosis in parietal 
white matter. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride, high body mass index, or 
smoking were not related to the severity of arteriolosclerosis in any brain 
region. None of the CVD-RFs were associated with the severity of spinal 
arteriolosclerosis. These data indicate that severity of arteriolosclerosis and 
its associations with CVD-RFs may vary in different CNS locations.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the associations of genetic and non-genetic 
factors with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is mounting evidence for an inherited 
predisposition for DCM, but uncertainty remains regarding specific genetic 
markers involved. Similarly, non-genetic factors are thought to play a role.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using diagnosis codes from hospital records linked to the 
UK Biobank cohort, patients with cervical spondylosis were identified followed 
by the identification of a subset with DCM. Non-genetic variables evaluated 
included age, sex, race, Townsend deprivation index, body mass index, 
occupational demands, osteoporosis and smoking. Genome-wide association analyses 
were conducted using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, population 
principal components and follow-up.
RESULTS: 851 DCM cases out of 2787 cervical spondylosis patients were 
identified. Several non-genetic factors were independently associated with DCM 
including age (odds ratio [OR]=1.11, 95%CI=1.01-1.21, P=0.024), male sex (OR 
=1.63, 95%CI=1.37-1.93, P<0.001) and relative socioeconomic deprivation 
(OR=1.03, 95%CI=1.00-1.06, P=0.030). Asian race was associated with lower DCM 
risk (OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.22-0.85, P=0.014). We did not identify genome-wide 
significant (≤5×10-8) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
DCM. The strongest genome-wide signals were at SNP rs67256809 in the intergenic 
region of the genes LINC02582 and FBXO15 on chromosome 18 (P=1.12×10-7) and 
rs577081672 in the GTPBP1 gene on chromosome 22 (P=2.9×10-7). No SNPs reported 
in prior DCM studies were significant after adjusting for replication attempts.
CONCLUSION: Increasing age, male sex and relative socioeconomic deprivation were 
identified as independent risk factors for DCM, whereas Asian race was inversely 
associated. SNPs of potential interest were identified in GTPBP1 and an 
intergenic region on chromosome 18, but these associations did not reach 
genome-wide significance. Identification of genetic and non-genetic DCM 
susceptibility markers may guide understanding of DCM disease processes, inform 
risk, guide prevention and potentially inform surgical outcomes.

The novel robot-assisted (RA) technique has been utilized increasingly to 
improve the accuracy of cervical pedicle screw placement. Although the clinical 
application of the RA technique has been investigated in several case series and 
comparative studies, the superiority and safety of RA over conventional freehand 
(FH) methods remain controversial. Meanwhile, the intra-pedicular accuracy of 
the two methods has not been compared for patients with cervical traumatic 
conditions. This study aimed to compare the rate and risk factors of 
intra-pedicular accuracy of RA versus the conventional FH approach for posterior 
pedicle screw placement in cervical traumatic diseases. A total of 52 patients 
with cervical traumatic diseases who received cervical screw placement using RA 
(26 patients) and FH (26 patients) techniques were retrospectively included. The 
primary outcome was the intra-pedicular accuracy of cervical pedicle screw 
placement according to the Gertzbin-Robbins scale. Secondary outcome parameters 
included surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, 
postoperative hospital stay, and complications. Moreover, the risk factors that 
possibly affected intra-pedicular accuracy were assessed using univariate 
analyses. Out of 52 screws inserted using the RA method, 43 screws (82.7%) were 
classified as grade A, with the remaining 7 (13.5%) and 2 (3.8%) screws 
classified as grades B and C. In the FH cohort, 60.8% of the 79 screws were 
graded A, with the remaining screws graded B (21, 26.6%), C (8, 10.1%), and D 
(2, 2.5%). The RA technique showed a significantly higher rate of optimal 
intra-pedicular accuracy than the FH method (P = 0.008), but there was no 
significant difference between the two groups in terms of clinically acceptable 
accuracy (P = 0.161). Besides, the RA technique showed remarkably longer surgery 
time, less postoperative drainage, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and 
equivalent intraoperative blood loss and complications than the FH technique. 
Furthermore, the univariate analyses showed that severe obliquity of the lateral 
atlantoaxial joint in the coronal plane (P = 0.003) and shorter width of the 
lateral mass at the inferior margin of the posterior arch (P = 0.014) were risk 
factors related to the inaccuracy of C1 screw placement. The diagnosis of HRVA 
(P < 0.001), severe obliquity of the lateral atlantoaxial joint in the coronal 
plane (P < 0.001), short pedicle width (P < 0.001), and short pedicle height (P 
< 0.001) were risk factors related to the inaccuracy of C2 screw placement. RA 
cervical pedicle screw placement was associated with a higher rate of optimal 
intra-pedicular accuracy to the FH technique for patients with cervical 
traumatic conditions. The severe obliquity of the lateral atlantoaxial joint in 
the coronal plane independently contributed to high rates of the inaccuracy of 
C1 and C2 screw placements. RA pedicle screw placement is safe and useful for 
cervical traumatic surgery.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PURPOSE: To investigate the radiological phenotype, patient and surgery-related 
risk factors influencing postoperative clinical outcome for cervical myelopathy 
caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament involving C2 
following posterior instrumented laminectomy and fusion.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Ossified posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is 
caused by ectopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. It can 
cause neurological impairment and severe disability. For multilevel cervical 
OPLL, studies have shown good neurological recovery following cord decompression 
via either an anterior or posterior approach. There is, however, a lacunae in 
the literature regarding the outcomes of patients with OPLL extending to C2 and 
above (C2 [+]).
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 61 patients with C2 (+) OPLL who had 
posterior instrumented laminectomy and fusion at Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore 
between July 2011 and January 2021, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Data on 
demographics, clinical outcomes, radiology, and post-surgical outcomes were 
gathered.
RESULTS: Among 61 patients, 56 were males and five were females. The OPLL 
pattern was mixed in 32 cases (52.5%), continuous in 26 cases (42.6%), segmental 
in two cases (3.3%), and circumscribed in one patient (1.6%). All of our 
patients showed signs of neurological improvement after a 24-month follow-up. 
The mean preoperative modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score was 
10.6 (range, 5-11) and the postoperative mJOA score was 15.8 (range, 12-18). The 
recovery rate was >75% in 27 patients (44.6%), >50% in 32 patients (52.5%), and 
>25% in two patients (3.3%). The average recovery rate was 71% (range, 
33%-100%). The independent risk factor for predicting recovery rate is the 
preoperative mJOA score.
CONCLUSIONS: In C2 (+) OPLL, posterior instrumented decompression and fusion 
provide a relatively safe approach and satisfactory results.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective multicenter study.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of loss of cervical lordosis after 
laminoplasty for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament 
(OPLL). We also sought to determine associated risk factors and the relationship 
with patient-reported outcomes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Loss of cervical lordosis is a sequalae often 
observed after laminoplasty, which may adversely impact surgical outcomes. 
Cervical kyphosis, especially in OPLL, is associated with reoperation, but risk 
factors and relationship to postoperative outcomes remain understudied at this 
time.
METHODS: This study was conducted by the Japanese Multicenter Research 
Organization for Ossification of the Spinal Ligament. We included 165 patients 
who underwent laminoplasty and completed Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) 
score or Japanese Orthopaedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation 
Questionnaires (JOACMEQ), as well as visual analog scales (VAS) for pain, with 
imaging. The participants were divided into two groups: those with loss of 
cervical lordosis of>10° or 20° after surgery and those without loss of cervical 
lordosis. A paired t-test was applied to evaluate the association between 
changes in cervical spinal angles, ROM, and cervical JOA and VAS scores before 
and at 2 years postoperatively. Mann-Whitney U-test was used for JOACMEQ.
RESULTS: Postoperative loss of cervical lordosis>10° and>20° was observed in 32 
(19.4%) and 7 (4.2%), respectively. JOA, JOACMEQ, and VAS scores were not 
significantly different between those with, and without, loss of cervical 
lordosis. Preoperative small extension range of motion (eROM) was significantly 
associated with postoperative loss of cervical lordosis, and the cutoff values 
of eROM were 7.4° [area under the curve (AUC): 0.76] and 8.2° (AUC: 0.92) for 
loss of cervical lordosis>10° and>20°, respectively. A large occupation ratio of 
OPLL was also associated with loss of cervical lordosis, with a cutoff value of 
39.9% (AUC: 0.94). Laminoplasty resulted in functional improvement in most 
patient-reported outcomes; however, neck pain and bladder function tended to 
become worse postoperatively in cases with postoperative loss of cervical 
lordosis>20°.
CONCLUSION: JOA, JOACMEQ, and VAS scores were not significantly different 
between those with, and without, loss of cervical lordosis. Preoperative small 
eROM and large OPLL may represent factors associated with loss of cervical 
lordosis after laminoplasty in patients with OPLL.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the postoperative 
motor and somatosensory functional recoveries of degenerative cervical 
myelopathy (DCM) patients.
METHODS: Motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEP and SSEPs) and modified 
Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores were recorded in 27 diabetic 
(DCM-DM group) and 38 non-diabetic DCM patients (DCM group) before and 1 year 
after surgery. The central motor (CMCT) and somatosensory (CSCT) conduction time 
were recorded to evaluate the conductive functions of the spinal cord.
RESULTS: The mJOA scores, CMCT and CSCT improved (t test, p < 0.05) in both of 
the DCM-DM and DCM groups 1 year after surgery. The mJOA recovery rate (RR) and 
CSCT recovery ratio were significantly worse (t test, p < 0.05) in the DCM-DM 
group compared to the DCM group. DM proved to be a significant independent risk 
factor for poor CSCT recovery (OR = 4.52, 95% CI 2.32-7.12) after adjusting for 
possible confounding factors. In DCM-DM group, CSCT recovery ratio was also 
correlated with preoperative HbA1 level (R =  - 0.55, p = 0.003). Furthermore, 
DM duration longer than 10 years and insulin dependence were risk factors for 
lower mJOA, CMCT and CSCT recoveries among all DCM-DM patients (t test, 
p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DM may directly hinders spinal cord conduction recovery in DCM 
patients after surgery. Corticospinal tract impairments are similar between DCM 
and DCM-DM patients, but significantly worsened in chronic or insulin-dependent 
DM patients. The dorsal column is more sensitively affected in all DCM-DM 
patients. Deeper investigation into the mechanisms and neural regeneration 
strategies is needed.

OBJECTIVE: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1 in 700 live births and approximately 
one-third of patients develop craniovertebral junction (CVJ) instability, 
diagnosed by clinical examination and radiological measures such as the 
atlantodens interval (ADI) and space available for the cord (SAC). Patients with 
symptomatic CVJ instability are at increased risk for spinal cord injury. There 
are no guidelines for surgical management of CVJ instability in DS, the existing 
literature is sparse, and there is a lack of consistent pediatric data. This 
systematic review aimed to synthesize practice patterns of the surgical 
management of CVJ stability in pediatric DS patients to facilitate future 
standardization of care.
METHODS: Peer-reviewed studies reporting surgical management of CVJ instability 
in pediatric DS patients were systematically reviewed. Inclusion criteria were 
studies reporting primary data on patients younger than 18 years with DS, who 
had CVJ instability evaluation and underwent surgical treatment. Bias risk was 
assessed. Descriptive statistics of the independent patient data were presented. 
Interval variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
RESULTS: Of 1056 records, 38 studies were included. Of the included patients, 
169 (6%) underwent surgery. The surgical indication was symptomatic, 
radiologically confirmed CVJ instability in 81% of the patients, presenting with 
myelopathy (30%), weakness (25%), abnormal gait (24%), torticollis (15%), and 
neck pain (14%). A cutoff of ADI ≥ 4 mm or SAC ≤ 14 mm, cord compression, cord 
signal change, and anomalous bony anatomy were used in diagnosing CVJ 
instability. Surgical approaches focused on internal fixation with posterior 
occipitocervical or atlantoaxial instrumented fusion in 57% and 44% of patients, 
respectively. Autograft, wiring, and allograft constructs were used in 48%, 45%, 
and 9% of patients. Anterior cervical approaches were performed in 6% of 
patients. Preoperative and postoperative external orthoses were used in 
approximately 50% of patients. The surgical mortality rate was 3%, and the 
complication rate was 36%.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of CVJ instability in DS is based on radiographic and 
clinical factors. Surgery is recommended if symptoms are present, and the 
procedure type depends on patient factors, degree of instability, anomalous bony 
anatomy, and reduction results to relieve cord compression. Most commonly, 
posterior instrumented fusion is used. However, further research is required to 
determine the strength of evaluation methods, create standardized guidelines for 
evaluation and surgical treatment, and investigate the long-term results of 
different surgical techniques.

BACKGROUND: Despite current best practices, pressure injuries (PI) remain a 
devastating and prevalent hospital-acquired complication for patients with acute 
traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs). This study examined associations between 
risk factors for PI development in patients with complete SCI, such as 
norepinephrine dose and duration, and other demographic factors or lesion 
characteristics.
METHODS: This case-control study included adults with acute complete SCIs 
ASIA-A, who were admitted to a level-one trauma center between 2014-18. A 
retrospective review was implement using data on patient and injury 
characteristics, including age, gender, level of SCI (cervical vs. thoracic), 
Injury Severity Score (ISS), length of stay (LOS) and mortality; 
presence/absence of PI during their acute hospital stay; and treatment factors 
such as spinal surgery, mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets, and vasopressor 
treatment. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations with PI.
RESULTS: Eighty-two out of 103 eligible patients had complete data, and 30 (37%) 
developed PIs. Patient and injury characteristics, including age (Mean: 50.6; 
SD:21.3), location of SCI (48 cervical, 59%) and ISS (Mean 33.1; SD:11.8), did 
not differ between PI and non-PI groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed 
that male gender (OR:34.1; CI95:2.3-506.5, p = 0.010) and increased LOS 
(log-transformed; OR:20.5, CI95:2.8-149.9, p = 0.003) were associated with 
increased risk of PI. Having an order for a MAP > 80mmg (OR:0.05; 
CI95:0.01-0.30, p = 0.001) was associated with a reduced risk of PI. There were 
no significant associations between PI and duration of norepinephrine treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Norepinephrine treatment parameters were not associated with 
development of PI, suggesting that MAP targets should be a focus for future 
investigations for SCI management. Increasing LOS should highlight the need for 
high-risk PI prevention and vigilance.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical disc replacement (CDR) is an alternative treatment to 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), which is the current gold 
standard, for degenerative cervical diseases such as cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy and cervical radiculopathy. CDR has several theoretical benefits over 
ACDF, including preservation of motion, earlier return to unrestricted activity, 
and potentially a lower risk of adjacent-segment disease. Recent literature has 
reported positive clinical results for CDR, but few studies have investigated 
the long-term risk of revision surgery of CDR versus ACDF. The purpose of this 
study was to identify and analyze the epidemiological, clinical, and operative 
risk factors that affect revision rates following single-level CDR and ACDF 
procedures.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort was extracted from the Statewide Planning and 
Research Cooperative System using ICD-9 and CPT codes. Inclusion criteria were 
adult patients undergoing primary, subaxial (C3-7), single-level ACDF or CDR for 
cervical radiculopathy and/or cervical spondylotic myelopathy between 2005 and 
2013. Survivability was defined as the time between the index procedure and the 
presence of a subsequent discharge record for cervical spinal fusion or disc 
replacement. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square tests, 
t-tests, Cox proportional hazards models, and a Kaplan-Meier plot.
RESULTS: A total of 7450 patients were included in this study (6615 ACDF and 835 
CDR). When adjusted for patient demographics, the hazard ratios showed no 
significant differences in the incidence of revision risk between the two 
cohorts. The CDR cohort had a higher incidence of postoperative dysphagia (p < 
0.05). Patients undergoing ACDF had a longer average hospital stay (2.8 vs 1.9 
days, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in time to revision 
surgery (p = 0.486).
CONCLUSIONS: CDR and ACDF have both been shown to be effective treatments for 
cervical spine disease. CDR patients had a shorter average inpatient hospital 
stay compared with ACDF patients but tended to experience dysphagia more 
frequently. There was a tendency toward increased survivability of CDR; however, 
this was not found to be statistically significant at any time point. The large 
size and heterogeneity of each cohort and the availability of > 10 years of 
surveillance data differentiate this study from other published literature. This 
investigation has limitations inherent to large data analysis studies, including 
the implementation and inaccuracy of diagnosis and procedural coding; however, 
this reflects real-world use of coding by practitioners.

BACKGROUND: Cervical sagittal parameters and paravertebral muscle degeneration 
are important factors for the occurrence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. 
However, the relationship between the 2 risk factors and cervical kyphosis 
following cervical laminoplasty remains unknown.
METHODS: A total of 130 patients undergoing cervical laminoplasty were enrolled 
from July 2018 to July 2020 and were followed up for at least 24 months. 
Clinical recovery was recorded, including the Japanese Orthopedic Association, 
neck disability index and visual analog scale scores. Radiographic sagittal 
parameters were measured on cervical lateral radiographs: T1 slope (T1S), C2-C7 
Cobb lordotic angle (CLA), C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis, O-C2 angle, and 
T1S-CLA. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters of the paraspinal 
muscles were also measured, including cross-sectional area and fat infiltration 
(FI). The patients were divided into a kyphosis group and a lordosis group based 
on the last follow-up results of CLA. Multivariate logistic analysis was 
performed to analyze risk factors for kyphosis following laminoplasty.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were assigned to the kyphosis group and 98 were 
assigned to the lordosis group. Patient baseline and surgical information in the 
2 groups showed no statistically significant difference. In the comparison of 
clinical recovery, patients with kyphosis showed a lower Japanese Orthopedic 
Association recovery rate than the lordosis group. For the radiographic 
parameters and muscle condition comparison, CLA, T1S-CLA, and FI were the most 
significant parameters. The logistic regression revealed that T1S-CLA and FI 
were the most important variables that predicted kyphosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that FI remarkably differed in the paraspinal muscles 
in the 2 groups. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that T1S-CLA and 
FI significantly influenced the process of kyphosis after cervical laminoplasty.

Cylindrical cages were known to cause subsidence after anterior cervical 
discectomy and fusion (ACDF); hence, they were gradually replaced by box-shaped 
cages. However, this phenomenon has been inconclusive due to limited information 
and short-term results. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify risk factors for 
subsidence after ACDF using titanium double cylindrical cages with mid-term 
follow-up periods. This retrospective study included 49 patients (76 segments) 
diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy caused by disc herniation, 
spondylosis, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. These 
patients underwent ACDF using these cages from January 2016 to March 2020 in a 
single institution. Patient demographics and neurological outcomes were also 
examined. Subsidence was defined as a ≥3-mm segmental disc height decrease at 
the final follow-up lateral X-ray compared to that on the next day 
postoperatively. Subsidence occurred in 26 of 76 segments (34.7%) within the 
follow-up periods of approximately three years. Multivariate analysis using a 
logistic regression model demonstrated that multilevel surgery was significantly 
associated with subsidence. The majority of patients achieved good clinical 
outcomes based on the Odom criteria. This study demonstrated that multilevel 
surgery was the only risk factor of subsidence post-ACDF with double cylindrical 
cages. Despite the relatively high subsidence rates, the clinical outcome was 
almost good at least during the mid-term period.

OBJECTIVE: Facet articular irregularity is associated with rapidly progressive 
degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). However, its significance compared with 
other known risk factors remains unknown. Therefore, this retrospective study 
aimed to clarify the potential impact of facet articular irregularity as a risk 
factor for rapid DCM progression.
METHODS: This study included 141 consecutive patients with DCM who underwent 
surgical treatment at our institution. Clinical variables and radiological 
findings related to DCM progression were collected. Imaging findings were 
analyzed at the segmental level of myelopathy in each case. The patients were 
divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of rapid DCM progression, 
and independent risk factors were determined using logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Overall, 131 patients with a mean age of 63.9 ± 12.6 years were 
analyzed; 27 patients (20.6%) were classified into the rapid DCM progression 
group. The mean age was significantly higher in the rapid progression group than 
in the slow progression group (72.4 ± 9.6 vs. 61.7 ± 12.4, p < 0.001). According 
to univariate analysis, facet articular irregularity, dynamic segmental 
translation (≥ 1.6 mm), upper cervical spine involvement above C4-5, history of 
cerebrovascular events, preceding minor trauma, local lordotic angle (≥ 4.5°), 
diabetes, hypertension, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and age were independent 
risk factors. Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that facet articular 
irregularity was the highest risk factor for rapid DCM progression (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Facet articular irregularity is the most clinically significant 
finding among the known risk factors in patients with rapid DCM progression.

C5 palsy is a frequent sequela of cervical decompression surgeries for cervical 
myeloradiculopathy. Although many researchers have suggested various risk 
factors, such as cord shifting and the correction of lordotic angles, the 
tethering of the C5 root beneath the narrow foramen is an independent risk 
factor for C5 palsy. In this study, we tried to investigate different techniques 
for foramen decompression with posterior cervical fusion and assess the 
incidence of C5 palsy with each technique depending on the order of foraminal 
decompression. A combined 540° approach with LMS and uncovertebrectomy was used 
in group 1. Group 2 combined a 540° approach with pedicle screws and posterior 
foraminotomy, while posterior approach only with pedicle screws and foraminotomy 
was used in group 3. For groups 2 and 3, prophylactic posterior foraminotomy was 
performed before laminectomy. Motor manual testing to assess C5 palsy, the Neck 
Disability Index (NDI) and the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores were 
determined before and after surgery. Simple radiographs, MRI and CT scans, were 
obtained to assess radiologic parameters preoperatively and postoperatively. A 
total of 362 patients were enrolled in this study: 208 in group 1, 72 in group 
2, and 82 in group 3. The mean age was 63.2, 65.5, and 66.6 years in groups 1, 
2, and 3, respectively. The median for fused levels was 4 for the three groups. 
There was no significant difference between groups regarding the number of fused 
levels. Weight, height, comorbidities, and diagnosis were not significantly 
different between groups. Preoperative JOA scores were similar between groups (p 
= 0.256), whereas the preoperative NDI score was significantly higher in group 3 
than in group 2 (p = 0.040). Mean JOA score at 12-month follow-up was 15.5 ± 
1.89, 16.1 ± 1.48, and 16.1 ± 1.48 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; it was 
higher in group 3 compared with group 1 (p = 0.008) and in group 2 compared with 
group 1 (p = 0.024). NDI score at 12 months was 13, 12, and 13 in groups 1, 2, 
and 3, respectively; it was significantly better in group 3 than in group 1 (p = 
0.040), but there were no other significant differences between groups. The 
incidence of C5 palsy was significantly lower in posterior foraminotomy groups 
with pedicle screws (groups 2 and 3) than in LMS with uncovertebrectomy (group 
1) (p < 0.001). Thus, preventive expansive foraminotomy before decompressive 
laminectomy is able to significantly decrease the root tethering by stenotic 
lesion, and subsequently, decrease the incidence of C5 palsy associated with 
posterior only or combined posterior and anterior cervical fusion surgeries. 
Additionally, such expansive foraminotomy might be appropriate with pedicle 
screw insertion based on biomechanical considerations.

Open-door laminoplasty is widely used for patients with cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy (CSM). However, the loss of cervical lordosis (LCL) seems to be 
unavoidable in the long-term follow-up after surgery, which may affect the 
clinical outcomes. The risk factors for this complication are still unclear. In 
this study, patients who underwent open-door laminoplasty between April 2016 and 
June 2021 were enrolled. Cervical X-rays were obtained to measure the C2-7 Cobb 
angle, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 slope (T1S) and ranges of motion 
(ROM). Cervical computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) were collected to evaluate the cervical Hounsfield unit values (HU) and 
the relative cross-sectional area (RCSA) of paraspinal muscles, respectively. A 
total of 42 patients were included and the average follow-up period was 24.9 
months. Among the patients, 24 cases (57.1%) had a LCL of more than 5° at a 
1-year follow-up and were labeled as members of the LCL group. The follow-up JOA 
scores were significantly lower in the LCL group (13.9 ± 0.6 vs. 14.4 ± 0.8, p = 
0.021) and the mean JOA recovery rate was negatively correlated with LCL (r = 
-0.409, p = 0.007). In addition, LCL was positively correlated to the 
preoperative T1S, flexion ROM, flexion/extension ROM and the RCSA of 
flexion/extension muscles, while it was negatively correlated to extension ROM 
and the HU value of cervical vertebrae. Furthermore, multiple linear regression 
showed that preoperative T1S, mean HU value of cervical vertebrae, 
flexion/extension ROM and the flexion/extension RCSA were independent risk 
factors for LCL. Spine surgeons should consider these parameters before 
performing open-door laminoplasty.

STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of a national multi-institutional 
database of 27,808 extradural cervical spine procedures performed between 
January 2017 and May 2021.
OBJECTIVE: Characterize intraoperative neuromonitoring alerts by the patterns of 
modalities and nerves/muscles involved and quantify risk of new-onset 
neurological deficit for patients with a primary diagnosis of myelopathy, 
stenosis, or radiculopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Phenotyping alert patterns and linking those 
patterns with risk is needed to facilitate clinical decision-making.
METHODS: Cases with alerts were categorized by patterns of modalities or 
nerves/muscles involved, and alert status at closure. Unadjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) for new-onset neurological deficit were calculated. A mixed-effects 
logistic regression model controlling for demographic and operative factors, 
with random intercepts to account for clustering in outcomes by surgeon and 
surgical neurophysiologist was also used to calculate ORs and probabilities of 
neurological deficit.
RESULTS: There was significantly increased risk of a new neurological deficit 
for procedures involving posterior compared with anterior approaches (OR: 1.82, 
P=0.001) and procedures involving three levels compared with one (OR: 2.17, 
P=0.001). Odds of a deficit were lower for patients with radiculopathy compared 
with myelopathy (OR: 0.69, P=0.058). Compared with cases with no alerts, those 
with unresolved Spinal Cord alerts were associated with the greatest elevation 
in risk (OR: 289.05) followed by unresolved C5-6 Nerve Root (OR: 172.7), C5-T1 
Nerve Root/Arm (OR: 162.89), C7 Nerve Root (OR:84.2), and C8-T1 Nerve Root 
alerts (OR:75.49, all P<0.001). Significant reductions in risk were seen for 
resolved Spinal Cord, C5-6 Nerve Root, and C8-T1 nerve alerts. Overall, 
unresolved motor evoked potential and somatosensory evoked potential alerts were 
associated with the greatest elevation in risk (OR:340.92) followed by 
unresolved motor evoked potential-only (OR:140.6) and unresolved somatosensory 
evoked potential-Only alerts (OR:78.3, all P<0.001). These relationships were 
similar across diagnostic cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk elevation and risk mitigation after an intraoperative 
neuromonitoring alert during surgery is dependent on the type and pattern of 
alert.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort Study OBJECTIVE: Myelopathy following 
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is one of the 
devastating clinical features in these patients, while we still know little 
about which factors are associated with development of myelopathy. We evaluated 
the difference of radiologic measurements between OPLL patients with or without 
myelopathy and searched for the clinical significance with emphasis on the 
impact of dynamic motion.
METHODS: 305 patients diagnosed of OPLL were enrolled for retrospective review. 
They were divided into two groups according to the coexistence of radiographic 
evidence of myelopathy. Demographic data as well as radiologic measures 
including the presence of disc degeneration (DD), anterior-posterior diameter 
(APD) of central canal, canal compromise (CC) ratio, global and segmental range 
of motion (gROM and sROM), OPLL type (morphologic classification) and K-line 
were collected.
RESULTS: APD (odds ratio (OR); 0.411), CC ratio (OR; 1.100) and sROM (OR; 1.371) 
were significantly associated with the presence of myelopathy in the 
multivariate analysis. While the statistically significant factors were same in 
OPLLs with CC larger than 50%, presence of DD (OR; 4.509) and sROM (OR; 1.295) 
were significantly associated with myelopathy but not the CC itself in OPLLs 
with CC smaller than 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that the APD, CC ratio and sROM had significant 
association with development of myelopathy in OPLLs. And the presence of dynamic 
factors had significant association with myelopathy in OPLLs with smaller CC 
ratios. This observation and its clinical significance on development of 
myelopathy might enhance our understanding of OPLL.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy frequently 
have severe symptoms due to spondylolisthesis. The effectiveness of laminoplasty 
for degenerative cervical spondylolisthesis (DCS) is an important question.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to elucidate factors associated with the 
outcome of laminoplasty for DCS.
METHOD: Eighty-nine patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) who 
underwent laminoplasty without instrumented posterior fusion were enrolled. 
Positive spondylolisthesis was defined as more than 2 mm during neck flexion or 
extension, from this, 46 DCS cases and 43 non-DCS cases were classified. 
Radiological parameters, including cervical alignment, balance, range of motion, 
and slippage along with the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, were 
obtained before and 1 year after surgery. Factors associated with good surgical 
outcomes for DCS were analyzed using multivariate logistic analysis.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in background and preoperative 
JOA score, but the DCS group recovery rate was significantly less (42% vs 53%). 
Multivariate logistic analysis revealed only the postoperative C2-7 angle during 
neck flexion was associated with a favorable outcome for DCS (P = 0.0039, Odds 
ratio: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.14-1.94). Multivariate regression analysis positively 
correlated the preoperative C2-7 angle in neutral and during flexion with the 
postoperative C2-7 angle during flexion.
CONCLUSION: The major factor related to poor outcome was the magnitude of 
postoperative kyphotic C2-7 angle during neck flexion. Slippage was not directly 
related to outcome and postoperative cervical alignment. Caution is recommended 
for surgeons performing laminoplasty on patients with risk factors for 
postoperative excessive kyphotic C2-7 angle during flexion.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study, level of evidence 1 for 
prognostic investigations.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of sleep impairment and predictors of 
improved sleep quality 24 months postoperatively in cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy (CSM) using the quality outcomes database.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sleep disturbances are a common yet understudied 
symptom in CSM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quality outcomes database was queried for patients 
with CSM, and sleep quality was assessed through the neck disability index sleep 
component at baseline and 24 months postoperatively. Multivariable logistic 
regressions were performed to identify risk factors of failure to improve sleep 
impairment and symptoms causing lingering sleep dysfunction 24 months after 
surgery.
RESULTS: Among 1135 patients with CSM, 904 (79.5%) had some degree of sleep 
dysfunction at baseline. At 24 months postoperatively, 72.8% of the patients 
with baseline sleep symptoms experienced improvement, with 42.5% reporting 
complete resolution. Patients who did not improve were more like to be smokers 
[adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.85], have osteoarthritis (aOR: 1.72), report 
baseline radicular paresthesia (aOR: 1.51), and have neck pain of ≥4/10 on a 
numeric rating scale. Patients with improved sleep noted higher satisfaction 
with surgery (88.8% vs 72.9%, aOR: 1.66) independent of improvement in other 
functional areas. In a multivariable analysis including pain scores and several 
myelopathy-related symptoms, lingering sleep dysfunction at 24 months was 
associated with neck pain (aOR: 1.47) and upper (aOR: 1.45) and lower (aOR: 
1.52) extremity paresthesias.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients presenting with CSM have associated sleep 
disturbances. Most patients experience sustained improvement after surgery, with 
almost half reporting complete resolution. Smoking, osteoarthritis, radicular 
paresthesia, and neck pain ≥4/10 numeric rating scale score are baseline risk 
factors of failure to improve sleep dysfunction. Improvement in sleep symptoms 
is a major driver of patient-reported satisfaction. Incomplete resolution of 
sleep impairment is likely due to neck pain and extremity paresthesia.

We prospectively investigated the postoperative dysphagia in cervical posterior 
longitudinal ligament ossification (C-OPLL) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy 
(CSM) to identify the risk factors of each disease and the incidence. A series 
of 55 cases with C-OPLL: 13 anterior decompression with fusion (ADF), 16 
posterior decompression with fusion (PDF), and 26 laminoplasty (LAMP), and a 
series of 123 cases with CSM: 61 ADF, 5 PDF, and 57 LAMP, were included. 
Vertebral level, number of segments, approach, and with or without fusion, and 
pre and postoperative values of Bazaz dysphagia score, C2-7 lordotic angle 
(&ang;C2-7), cervical range of motion, O-C2 lordotic angle, cervical Japanese 
Orthopedic Association score, and visual analog scale for neck pain were 
investigated. New dysphagia was defined as an increase in the Bazaz dysphagia 
score by one grade or more than one year after surgery. New dysphagia occurred 
in 12 cases with C-OPLL; 6 with ADF (46.2%), 4 with PDF (25%), 2 with LAMP 
(7.7%), and in 19 cases with CSM; 15 with ADF (24.6%), 1 with PDF (20%), and 3 
with LAMP (1.8%). There was no significant difference in the incidence between 
the two diseases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increased &ang;C2-7 
was a risk factor for both diseases.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic Spinal Injuries (TSI) often follow high velocity injuries 
and frequently accompanied by polytrauma. While most studies have focussed on 
outcomes of spinal cord injuries, the incidence and risk factors that predict 
morbidity and mortality after TSI has not been well-defined.
METHODS: Data of consecutive patients of TSI (n = 2065) treated over a 
5-year-period were evaluated for demographics, injury mechanisms, neurological 
status, associated injuries, timing of surgery and co-morbidities. The 
thirty-day incidence and risk factors for complications, length of stay and 
mortality were analysed.
RESULTS: The incidence of spinal trauma was 6.2%. Associated injuries were seen 
in 49.7% (n = 1028), and 33.5% (n = 692) patients had comorbidities. The 30-day 
mortality was 0.73% (n = 15). Associated chest injuries (p = 0.0001), cervical 
spine injury (p = 0.0001), ASIA-A neurology (p < 0.01) and ankylosing 
spondylitis (p = 0.01) correlated with higher mortality. Peri-operative 
morbidity was noted in 571 patients (27.7%) and were significantly associated 
with age > 60 (p = 0.043), ASIA-A neurology (p < 0.05), chest injuries 
(p = 0.042), cervical and thoracic spine injury (p < 0.0001). The mean length of 
stay in hospital was 8.87 days. Cervical spine injury (p < 0.0001), delay in 
surgery > 48 h (p = 0.011), Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01), Ankylosing spondylitis 
(p = 0.009), associated injuries of chest, head, pelvis and face (p < 0.05) were 
independent risk factors for longer hospital stay.
CONCLUSION: Key predictors of mortality after spinal trauma were cervical spine 
injury, complete neurological deficit, chest injuries and ankylosing 
spondylitis, while additionally higher age and thoracic injuries contributed to 
higher morbidity and prolonged hospitalisation. Notably multi-level injuries, 
higher age, co-morbidities and timing of surgery did not influence the 
mortality.

Patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) have many risk factors 
for myelopathy and paresis. These are spinal cord compression, bone stenosis, 
and soft tissue thickening with ligament laxity, deformity, odontoid hypoplasia, 
and atlantoaxial instability. Although most patients with MPS IVA appear 
generally healthy at birth, patients often show skeletal deformities within a 
few years. Surgical indications are difficult to determine. Historically, many 
physicians have used prophylactic decompression and fusion in young, 
asymptomatic MPS IVA patients to prevent cord compression. Although spinal cord 
decompression is usually required at the craniocervical junction in patients 
with MPS IVA, decompression may be required at other spinal cord levels as well. 
There is a risk of developing neurological damage during surgery. The most 
common causes are ischemia secondary to cardiac output deteriorated in the prone 
position or due to artery damage, and local trauma due to neck movements or 
traction while bringing the patient to the prone position. Neurophysiological 
monitoring is very important during surgery to reduce the risk of neurological 
damage in spinal cord surgery. In this case report, a case with loss of lower 
extremity neuromonitorization motor evoked potential (MEP) responses in the 
early period of surgery without any intervention to the craniocervical junction 
after prone positioning will be presented.

Distal junctional kyphosis (DJK) is defined as the development of a kyphotic 
angulation over 10 degrees below a fusion construct and has been described as a 
complication of the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, Scheuermann 
kyphosis, adult spinal deformity, and cervical deformity. There are some 
inherent risk factors to DJK: multilevel fusions, damage to the midline soft 
tissues including interspinous/supraspinous ligaments, T5-T12 thoracic kyphosis, 
T11-L2 thoracolumbar kyphosis, and increased mismatch between cervical lordosis 
and T1 slope. A 53-year-old male presented with cervicalgia, inability to 
sustain horizontal gaze, and kyphosis-enabled forward head posture. He underwent 
C3-T1 posterior decompression and fusion as treatment for cervical myelopathy 18 
months prior. Neurologic examination was normal, with appreciable protrusion of 
the T1 vertebral spinous process. Surgery was initiated through subperiosteal 
exposure of C2-T6, followed by removal of previously set instrumentation, 
placement of new screws, and posterior column osteotomies of selected segments. 
Final steps involved compression across excised portions, locking pedicle 
screws, and a multirod insertion after closure of the posterior column 
osteotomies by compression maneuvers. Correction for DJK encompasses sagittal 
alignment restoration, a stable construct, and a good biological environment for 
healing. Failure of DJK realignment can occur if the patient's ligaments 
deteriorate distal to the construct or fractures develop in vertebral bodies at 
the lowest instrumented vertebra or lowest instrumented vertebra +1. One year 
after surgery, the patient's condition improved, evidenced from both patient 
self-report and a standing posture radiograph.

Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning algorithm that can be 
utilized for identification of patient characteristics important for outcome 
prediction. Posterior cervical decompression with instrumented fusion (PCDF) is 
a procedure for the management of cervical spondylosis, cervical spinal 
stenosis, and degenerative disorders that can cause cervical myelopathy or 
radiculopathy. An RF algorithm was employed to predict and describe length of 
stay (LOS), readmission, reoperation, transfusion, and infection rates following 
elective PCDF using The American College of Surgeons National Quality 
Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database 2008 through 2018. The RF algorithm was 
tasked with determining the importance of independent clinical variables in 
predicting our outcomes of interest and importance of each variable based on the 
reduction in the Gini index. Application of an RF algorithm to the ACS-NSQIP 
database yielded a highly predictive set of patient characteristics and 
perioperative events for five outcomes of interest related to elective PCDF. 
These variables included postoperative infection, increased age, BMI, operative 
time, and LOS, and decreased preoperative hematocrit and white blood cell count. 
Risk factors that were predictive for rate of reoperation, readmission, hospital 
length of stay, transfusion requirement, and post-operative infection were 
identified with AUC values of 0.781, 0.791, 0.781, 0.902, and 0.724 
respectively. Utilization of these findings may assist in risk analysis during 
the perioperative period and may influence clinical or surgical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy and chronic hypertension show a 
cause-effect relationship. Hypertension increases cardiovascular risk and is 
associated with intraoperative hypotension. We aimed to evaluate intraoperative 
hypotension in patients undergoing non-emergency decompression surgery for 
cervical spondylosis and its association with clinical myelopathy and chronic 
arterial hypertension.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used healthcare data of adult patients 
undergoing cervical spine surgeries at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 
2015 to 2019. The primary outcomes were the incidence of intraoperative 
hypotension and predictive factors, and the secondary outcomes were the 
association of intraoperative hypotension and postoperative adverse outcomes in 
the surgical population.
RESULTS: Among the 1833 patients analyzed, 795 (43.4%) required vasopressor 
treatment and 342 (18.7%) showed persistent hypotension. Factors independent 
associated with hypotension after anesthetic induction were age [odds ratio 
(OR), 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.23 per 5 years, P < 0.001], 
male sex (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21-2.19, P < 0.001), chronic hypertension (OR, 
1.77; 95% CI, 1.32-2.38, P < 0.001), upper cervical spine level C0-2 treated 
(OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.92-4.84, P < 0.001 vs. C3-T1), and increased number of 
spine segments treated (OR, 1.43; 95% CI 1.26-1.63, P < 0.001). Patients who 
developed intraoperative hypotension experienced more acute postoperative kidney 
injury (OR, 7.90; 95% CI, 2.34-26.63, P < 0.001), greater need for intensive 
care (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.24-2.60, P = 0.002), and longer admission after 
surgery (1.09 days longer, 95% CI 0.06-2.12, P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative hypotension is common even in non-emergency cervical 
spine surgery. A history of hypertension independently predicted intraoperative 
hypotension. Prompt assessments for identifiable features can help ameliorate 
intraoperative hypotension.

OBJECTIVE: Patients who undergo surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy 
(CSM) will occasionally develop postoperative neck pain that was not present 
preoperatively, yet the incidence of this phenomenon is unclear. The authors 
aimed to elucidate patient and surgical factors associated with new-onset 
sustained pain after CSM surgery.
METHODS: The authors reviewed data from the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) CSM 
module. The presence of neck pain was defined using the neck pain numeric rating 
scale (NRS). Patients with no neck pain at baseline (neck NRS score ≤ 1) were 
then stratified based on the presence of new postoperative pain development 
(neck NRS score ≥ 2) at 12 and 24 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Of 1141 patients in the CSM QOD, 224 (19.6%) reported no neck pain at 
baseline. Among 170 patients with no baseline neck pain and available 12-month 
follow-up, 46 (27.1%) reported new postoperative pain. Among 184 patients with 
no baseline neck pain and available 24-month follow-up, 53 (28.8%) reported new 
postoperative pain. The mean differences in neck NRS scores were 4.3 for those 
with new postoperative pain compared with those without at 12 months (4.4 ± 2.2 
vs 0.1 ± 0.3, p < 0.001) and 3.9 at 24 months (4.1 ± 2.4 vs 0.2 ± 0.4, p < 
0.001). The majority of patients reporting new-onset neck pain reported being 
satisfied with surgery, but their satisfaction was significantly lower compared 
with patients without pain at the 12-month (66.7% vs 94.3%, p < 0.001) and 
24-month (65.4% vs 90.8%, p < 0.001) follow-ups. The baseline Neck Disability 
Index (NDI) was an independent predictor of new postoperative neck pain at both 
the 12-month and 24-month time points (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06; 
p = 0.002; and aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.026, respectively). The total 
number of levels treated was associated with new-onset neck pain at 12 months 
(aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.64; p = 0.005), and duration of symptoms more than 3 
months was a predictor of 24-month neck pain (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.01-10.22; p = 
0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased NDI at baseline, number of levels treated surgically, and 
duration of symptoms longer than 3 months preoperatively correlate positively 
with the risk of new-onset neck pain following CSM surgery. The majority of 
patients with new-onset neck pain still report satisfaction from surgery, 
suggesting that the risk of new-onset neck pain should not hinder indicated 
operations from being performed.

OBJECTIVES: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with zero-profile 
interbody has a lower incidence of complications in treating cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, postoperative axial neck pain is still 
commonly occurred, and the factors affecting which is not known. Here, we 
retrospectively analyze the risk factors for postoperative axial pain after 
performing ACDF with zero-profile implant in single-level CSM.
METHODS: Patients who suffered from single-level CSM and who received ACDF with 
zero-profile implant between 2018 January to 2020 December were reviewed. Of 180 
single-level CSM patients, 144 patients who passed the inclusion criteria were 
enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of 
postoperative axial pain as measured by postoperative neck visual analogue scale 
(nVAS). Clinical parameters including age, sex, smoking history, symptom 
duration, body mass index (BMI), the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) 
scores, as well as radiological parameters were obtained pre- and 
post-operatively, and the data were compared between two groups. Pearson's 
chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were implemented to identify 
statistically significant differences between subgroups for categorical and 
continuous data, respectively; otherwise, the data were tested with Student's 
t-test. Risk factors were identified using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the patients (97.8%) achieved satisfied neurological recovery, and 
88.2% of the patients achieved fusion at 1-year follow-up. 33% of the patients 
(48 patients out of 144) had sustained postoperative axial pain after the 
surgery. Comparison of different severity groups exhibited no significant 
differences in terms of the possible risk factors (P > 0.05) except for pre- and 
post-operative C2-C7 Cobb angles (6.33 ± 6.53 vs. 11.88 ± 7.41, P < 0.05; 
13.49 ± 5.31 vs 16.64 ± 7.34, P < 0.05). Furthermore, correlation analysis 
showed that the preoperative C2-C7 Cobb angle is significantly correlated with 
the severity of the postoperative axial pain (R2  = 0.83, P < 0.01). In 
addition, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the preoperative C2-C7 
Cobb angle is an independent predictor of postoperative axial pain (P < 0.01, 
OR = 0.53). Further receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis displayed 
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (P < 0.01) for preoperative C2-C7 Cobb 
angle, and the optimal cutoff was 8.4° (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.65).
CONCLUSION: The pre-operative C2-C7 Cobb angle is a risk factor for severe 
postoperative axial pain after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with 
zero-profile interbody, and we should be cautious when poor preoperative C2-C7 
Cobb angle is found in myelopathy patients planning to use zero-profile 
interbody to treat such patients.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP) continues to be a cause 
of concern after anterior surgical treatment for single- or multilevel cervical 
degenerative disc disease (CDDD). The current literature reports inconsistent 
incidence rates and contended risk factors in the development of CASP.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim is to determine the incidence of additional 
CASP-related surgeries after anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) or 
without fusion (ACD) for CDDD. Secondary outcomes include risk factors for the 
development of CASP and long-term clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS & METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study with a 
long-term follow up. Patients undergoing ACD(F) for CDDD between January 2012 
and December 2019 were included.
RESULTS: A total of 601 patients were included, with an average follow-up period 
of 5.0 years. Most patients underwent ACDF with stand-alone cages (87.7%). CASP 
developed in 58 (9.7%) patients, 41 (70.7%) of which required additional 
adjacent level surgery. ACD significantly accelerated the development of CASP. 
The C2-C7 Cobb angle appeared less lordotic upon early post-operative imaging in 
ACDF patients that later-on developed CASP. Baseline degeneration at the index 
level and adjacent levels was not significantly different between patients with 
and without CASP.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort, we observe a relatively 
low rate of additional surgery for CASP in ACDF with stand-alone cages. We 
suggest that surgical technique, fusion, segmental kyphosis and natural 
degeneration play a multifactorial role in the development of CASP. Complication 
rates were low and clinical outcomes were similar for all techniques used.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the temporal development of and risk factors for the 
occurrence of unfavourable urodynamic parameters during the first year after 
spinal cord injury (SCI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This population-based longitudinal study used data from 97 
adult patients with a single-event traumatic or ischaemic SCI who underwent 
video-urodynamic investigation (UDI) at a university SCI centre. The first 
occurrences of unfavourable urodynamic parameters (detrusor overactivity 
combined with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia [DO-DSD], maximum storage detrusor 
pressure ≥40 cmH2 O, bladder compliance <20 mL/cmH2 O, vesico-ureteric reflux 
[VUR] and any unfavourable parameter [composite outcome]) were evaluated using 
time-to-event analysis.
RESULTS: The majority of the population (87/97 [90%]) had at least one 
unfavourable urodynamic parameter. Most unfavourable urodynamic parameters were 
initially identified during the 1- or 3-month UDI, including 92% of the DO-DSD 
(78/85), 82% of the maximum storage pressure ≥40 cmH2 O (31/38), and 100% of the 
VUR (seven of seven) observations. No low bladder compliance was observed. The 
risk of DO-DSD was elevated in patients with thoracic SCI compared to those with 
lumbar SCI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.16-4.89). Risk of maximum storage detrusor pressure ≥40 cmH2 O was higher in 
males than females (aHR 8.33, 95% CI 2.51-27.66), in patients with a cervical 
SCI compared to those with lumbar SCI (aHR 14.89, 95% CI 3.28-67.55), and in 
patients with AIS Grade B or C compared to AIS Grade D SCI (aHR 6.17, 95% CI 
1.78-21.39). No risk factors were identified for the composite outcome of any 
unfavourable urodynamic parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: The first UDI should take place within 3 months after SCI as to 
facilitate early diagnosis of unfavourable urodynamic parameters and timely 
treatment. Neuro-urological guidelines and individualised management strategies 
for patients with SCI may be strengthened by considering sex and SCI 
characteristics in the scheduling of UDIs.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the correlation between the severity 
of disease and postoperative neurological recovery in patients with cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) combined with developmental spinal stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 114 CSM patients 
combined with developmental spinal stenosis admitted to our hospital from June 
2019 to June 2020 was performed. All of the patients who underwent posterior 
cervical unidoor vertebroplasty were divided into the mild, moderate, and severe 
groups according to the Torg-Pavlov ratio. The clinical data including patients' 
age, course of spinal cord high signal change, and first onset age were 
collected. The recovery time, preoperative, and postoperative Japanese 
Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores of patients in each group were compared 
with the calculation of the improvement rate. The correlation between the 
severity of disease and postoperative neurological recovery in CSM patients 
combined with developmental spinal stenosis was analyzed by Pearson correlation. 
The factors influencing postoperative neurological recovery were analyzed using 
multivariate logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the value of each influencing factor in 
predicting postoperative recovery.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the proportion of linear 
hyperintensity changes in the spinal cord, the age of first onset, the course of 
the disease, and the Torg-Pavlov ratio among the mild, moderate, and severe 
groups (P  <  0.05). The postoperative recovery time of the moderate and severe 
groups was significantly higher than that of the mild group, while the 
preoperative JOA score was significantly lower than that of the mild group. On 
the other hand, the postoperative recovery time of the severe group was 
prominently higher than that of the moderate group, whereas the preoperative JOA 
score was observably lower than that of the moderate group (P  <  0.05). Pearson 
correlation analysis showed that the postoperative recovery time was 
significantly negatively correlated with the Torg-Pavlov ratio, age at first 
onset, and disease course (r = -0.359, -0.502, -0.368, P  <  0.05), while it was 
positively correlated with spinal cord linear high-signal changes (r = 0.641, P  
<  0.05). Multifactorial logistic regression analysis revealed that the 
Torg-Pavlov ratio, age at first onset, and disease course were protective 
factors, while spinal cord linear high-signal alterations were risk factors 
affecting the recovery time of postoperative neurological function (P  <  0.05). 
The area under the curve (AUC) of the Torg-Pavlov ratio, linear hyperintensity 
changes in the spinal cord, age at first onset, and disease duration in 
predicting the postoperative neurological recovery time were 0.794, 0.767, 
0.772, and 0.802, respectively. The AUC predicted by the combined detection of 
each factor was 0.876, which was better than the area under the curve of single 
prediction.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CSM combined with developmental spinal stenosis were 
characterized by younger age of onset, a short course of the disease, and linear 
changes in the spinal cord high signal. The degree of developmental spinal 
stenosis may affect the postoperative recovery time of neurological function in 
CSM patients but had little effect on postoperative neurological recovery. The 
Torg-Pavlov ratio, age of first onset, course of the disease, and changes in the 
spinal cord linear hyperintensity were the factors that affected postoperative 
neurological recovery, which may provide a basis for reasonably predicting a 
postoperative neurological recovery in patients with CSM combined with 
developmental spinal stenosis.

OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between occupational settings and 
self-reported occupational exposures on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
survival and phenotypes.
METHODS: All patients seen in the University of Michigan Pranger ALS Clinic were 
invited to complete an exposure assessment querying past occupations and 
exposures. Standard occupational classification (SOC) codes for each job and the 
severity of various exposure types were derived. Cox proportional hazards models 
associated all-cause mortality with occupational settings and the self-reported 
exposures after adjusting for sex, diagnosis age, revised El Escorial criteria, 
onset segment, revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and time from 
symptom onset to diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression models with three 
categories, adjusted for age, assessed the association between occupational 
settings and exposures to onset segment.
RESULTS: Among the 378 ALS participants (median age, 64.7 years; 54.4% male), 
poorer survival was associated with work in SOC code "Production Occupations" 
and marginally with work in "Military Occupation"; poor survival associated with 
self-reported occupational pesticide exposure in adjusted models. Among onset 
segments: cervical onset was associated with ALS participants having ever worked 
in "Buildings and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations," "Construction 
and Extraction Occupations," and "Production Occupations"; bulbar onset with 
self-reported occupational exposure to radiation; and cervical onset with 
exposure to particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, metals, combustion 
and diesel exhaust, electromagnetic radiation, and radiation.
CONCLUSION: Occupational settings and self-reported exposures influence ALS 
survival and onset segment. Further studies are needed to explore and understand 
these relationships, most advantageously using prospective cohorts and detailed 
ALS registries.

OBJECTIVE: We carried out this study to explore the possible relationship 
between the cervical sagittal parameters in radiological images and axial neck 
pain (ANP) for patients who had underwent posterior cervical single-door 
laminoplasty.
METHOD: 141 patients were enrolled in the study from January 2018 to January 
2021, among which 38 were enrolled into the ANP group and 103 were enrolled into 
the non-ANP group. C2-7 Cobb angle, C2-7 sagittal vertex axis (SVA), thoracic 
inlet angle, neck tilt, and T1 slope were measured using computed tomography. 
Spearman correlation tests were used to analyze the possible correlation between 
radiological parameters and ANP. Logistic regression was carried out to analyze 
the potential risk factor for the occurrence of ANP. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve were used to evaluate 
the significant result and the optimal diagnostic value.
RESULTS: As for radiographic parameters in the sagittal plane, the results 
suggested that only T1 slope and C2-7 SVA were statistically different between 
the ANP and non-ANP group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.047). Patients whose surgery 
involved the C2 spinous process demonstrated severe ANP symptoms than patients 
in the non-ANP group (p = 0.003). The Spearman correlation test showed that no 
statistical differences were found between visual analog scale (VAS) and 
radiological morphology parameters and only C2 involvement was found to 
correlate with postoperative VAS with respect to surgery. Logistic multivariate 
regression analysis demonstrated that only C2 involvement and T1 slope were 
significantly different when C2-7 SVA, T1 slope, C2 involvement together were 
included into consideration, with p values of 0.01 and 0.001.
CONCLUSION: According to our research, C2 involvement and greater T1 slope were 
independent risk factors of ANP for the patients who underwent laminoplasty of 
cervical spine.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a meta-analysis on the survivorship of commonly performed 
cervical spine procedures to develop survival function curves for (i) second 
surgery at any cervical level, and (ii) adjacent level surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review of was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. 
Articles with cohorts of greater than 20 patients followed for a minimum of 36 
months and with available survival data were included. Procedures included were 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), cervical disc arthroplasty 
(ADR), laminoplasty (LAMP), and posterior laminectomy and fusion (PDIF). 
Reconstructed individual patient data were pooled across studies using 
parametric Bayesian survival meta-regression.
RESULTS: Of 1829 initial titles, 16 citations were included for analysis. 73 811 
patients were included in the second surgery analysis and 2858 patients in the 
adjacent level surgery analysis. We fit a Log normal accelerated failure time 
model to the second surgery data and a Gompertz proportional hazards model to 
the adjacent level surgery data. Relative to ACDF, the risk of second surgery 
was higher with ADR and PDIF with acceleration factors 1.73 (95% CrI: 1.04, 
2.80) and 1.35 (95% CrI: 1.25, 1.46) respectively. Relative to ACDF, the risk of 
second surgery was lower with LAMP with deceleration factor .06 (95% CrI: .05, 
.07). ADR decreased the risk of adjacent level surgery with hazard ratio .43 
(95% CrI: .33, .55).
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of clinical equipoise between fusion procedures, our 
analysis suggests superior survivorship with anterior procedures. For all 
procedures, laminoplasty demonstrated superior survivorship.

Over the past several decades, the incidence of early-onset cancers, often 
defined as cancers diagnosed in adults <50 years of age, in the breast, 
colorectum, endometrium, oesophagus, extrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, head 
and neck, kidney, liver, bone marrow, pancreas, prostate, stomach and thyroid 
has increased in multiple countries. Increased use of screening programmes has 
contributed to this phenomenon to a certain extent, although a genuine increase 
in the incidence of early-onset forms of several cancer types also seems to have 
emerged. Evidence suggests an aetiological role of risk factor exposures in 
early life and young adulthood. Since the mid-20th century, substantial 
multigenerational changes in the exposome have occurred (including changes in 
diet, lifestyle, obesity, environment and the microbiome, all of which might 
interact with genomic and/or genetic susceptibilities). However, the effects of 
individual exposures remain largely unknown. To study early-life exposures and 
their implications for multiple cancer types will require prospective cohort 
studies with dedicated biobanking and data collection technologies. Raising 
awareness among both the public and health-care professionals will also be 
critical. In this Review, we describe changes in the incidence of early-onset 
cancers globally and suggest measures that are likely to reduce the burden of 
cancers and other chronic non-communicable diseases.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Frailty is a common comorbidity associated with worsening 
outcomes in various medical and surgical fields. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score 
(HFRS) is a recently developed tool which assesses frailty using 109 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-10-CM) comorbidity codes to assess severity of frailty. However, there is a 
paucity of studies utilizing the HFRS with patients undergoing anterior cervical 
discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of HFRS on health 
care resource utilization following ACDF for CSM.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2016-2019.
PATIENT SAMPLE: All adult (≥18 years old) patients undergoing primary, ACDF for 
CSM were identified using the ICD-10 CM codes.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Weighted patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative 
complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and total admission costs were 
assessed.
METHODS: The 109 ICD-10 codes with pre-assigned values from 0.1 to 7.1 
pertaining to frailty were queried in each patient, with a cumulative HFRS ≥5 
indicating a frail patient. Patients were then categorized as either Low HFRS 
(HFRS<5) or Moderate to High HFRS (HFRS≥5). A multivariate stepwise logistic 
regression was used to determine the odds ratio for risk-adjusted extended LOS, 
non-routine discharge disposition, and increased hospital cost.
RESULTS: A total of 29,305 patients were identified, of which 3,135 (10.7%) had 
a Moderate to High HFRS. Patients with a Moderate to High HFRS had higher rates 
of 1 or more postoperative complications (Low HFRS: 9.5% vs. Moderate-High HFRS: 
38.6%, p≤.001), significantly longer hospital stays (Low HFRS: 1.8±1.7 days vs. 
Moderate-High HFRS: 4.4 ± 6.0, p≤.001), higher rates of non-routine discharge 
(Low HFRS: 5.8% vs. Moderate-High HFRS: 28.2%, p≤.001), and increased total cost 
of admission (Low HFRS: $19,691±9,740 vs. Moderate-High HFRS: $26,935±22,824, 
p≤.001) than patients in the Low HFRS cohort. On multivariate analysis, Moderate 
to High HFRS was found to be a significant independent predictor for extended 
LOS [OR: 3.19, 95% CI: (2.60, 3.91), p≤.001] and non-routine discharge 
disposition [OR: 3.88, 95% CI: (3.05, 4.95), p≤.001] but not increased cost [OR: 
1.10, 95% CI: (0.87, 1.40), p=.418].
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with a higher HFRS have increased 
total hospital costs, a longer LOS, higher complication rates, and more frequent 
nonroutine discharge compared with patients with a low HFRS following elective 
ACDF for CSM. Although frail patients should not be precluded from surgical 
management of cervical spine pathology, these findings highlight the need for 
peri-operative protocols to medically optimize patients to improve health care 
quality and decrease costs.

BACKGROUND: The 1-year mortality and functional prognoses of patients who 
received surgery for cervical trauma in the elderly remains unclear. The aim of 
this study is to investigate the rates of, and factors associated with mortality 
and the deterioration in walking capacity occurring 1 year after spinal fusion 
surgery for cervical fractures in patients 65 years of age or older.
METHODS: Three hundred thirteen patients aged 65 years or more with a traumatic 
cervical fracture who received spinal fusion surgery were enrolled. The patients 
were divided into a survival group and a mortality group, or a maintained 
walking capacity group and a deteriorated walking capacity group. We compared 
patients' backgrounds, trauma, and surgical parameters between the two groups. 
To identify factors associated with mortality or a deteriorated walking capacity 
1 year postoperatively, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
conducted.
RESULTS: One year postoperatively, the rate of mortality was 8%. A higher 
Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, a more severe the American Spinal Cord 
Injury Association impairment scale (AIS), and longer surgical time were 
identified as independent factors associated with an increase in 1-year 
mortality. The rate of deterioration in walking capacity between pre-trauma and 
1 year postoperatively was 33%. A more severe AIS, lower albumin (Alb) and 
hemoglobin (Hb) values, and a larger number of fused segments were identified as 
independent factors associated with the increased risk of deteriorated walking 
capacity 1 year postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year rate of mortality after spinal fusion surgery for 
cervical fracture in patients 65 years of age or older was 8%, and its 
associated factors were a higher CCI score, a more severe AIS, and a longer 
surgical time. The rate of deterioration in walking capacity was 33%, and its 
associated factors were a more severe AIS, lower Alb, lower Hb values, and a 
larger number of fused segments.

OBJECTIVE: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is routinely treated with 
surgical decompression, but disparate postoperative outcomes are frequently 
observed, ranging from complete neurological recovery to persistent decline. 
Although numerous clinical and radiological factors have been independently 
associated with failure to improve, the relative impact of these proposed risk 
factors remains obscure. In this study, the authors assess the combined role of 
clinical and radiographic parameters in contributing to failure to attain 
neurological improvement after surgery.
METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who underwent surgery for DCM between 
July 2013 and August 2018 at a single institution was identified from a 
prospectively maintained database. Retrospective chart review was undertaken to 
record perioperative clinical and radiographic parameters. Failure to improve on 
the last follow-up evaluation after surgery, defined as a change in modified 
Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score less than 2, was the primary 
outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The authors included 183 patients in the final cohort. In total, 109 
(59.6%) patients improved (i.e., responders with ΔmJOA score ≥ 2) after surgery 
and 74 (40.4%) were nonresponders with ΔmJOA score < 2. Baseline demographic 
variables and comorbidity rates were similar, whereas baseline Nurick score was 
the only clinical variable that differed between responders and nonresponders 
(2.7 vs 3.0, p = 0.02). In contrast, several preoperative radiographic variables 
differed between the groups, including presence and degree of cervical kyphosis, 
number of levels with bidirectional cord compression, presence and number of 
levels with T2-weighted signal change, intramedullary lesion (IML) length, Torg 
ratio, and both narrowest spinal canal and cord diameter. On multivariate 
analysis, preoperative degree of kyphosis at C2-7 (OR 1.19, p = 0.004), number 
of levels with bidirectional compression (OR 1.83, p = 0.003), and IML length 
(OR 1.14, p < 0.001) demonstrated the highest predictive power for nonresponse 
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.818). A risk factor 
point system that predicted failure of improvement was derived by incorporating 
these 3 variables.
CONCLUSIONS: When a large spectrum of both clinical and radiographic variables 
is considered, the degree of cervical kyphosis, number of levels with 
bidirectional compression, and IML length are the most predictive of nonresponse 
after surgery for DCM. Assessment of these radiographic factors can help guide 
surgical decision-making and more appropriately stratify patients in clinical 
trials.

Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), despite its possible 
complications, remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of patients 
with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy caused by cervical intervertebral disc 
herniation or spondylosis. Despite its high rate of incidence, postoperative 
dysphagia following ACDF is still poorly understood; its pathogenesis remains 
relatively unknown, and its risk factors are still a subject of debate. The aim 
of this study is to review the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and methods 
of prevention of dysphagia in ACDF patients. To this end, a literature review 
was conducted based on the PubMed internet database. Article titles were 
searched by using the following keywords: "dysphagia" and "anterior cervical 
discectomy and fusion" or "ACDF". The search was limited to prospective clinical 
studies evaluating dysphagia after ACDF surgery. Studies published in 
non-English languages, retrospective studies, cadaveric studies, reviews, case 
reports, study protocols, and commentary studies were excluded. Initially, 335 
studies were identified after a primary search. After the application of the 
exclusion criteria, 73 studies remained for the final analysis. This literature 
review focused on identifying the rate of dysphagia and the various risk factors 
leading to this complication by comparing and evaluating the current literature 
with a wide spectrum of heterogeneity concerning patients, surgeons, and 
surgical techniques. A mean dysphagia rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 9.6%-29.1%) based 
on the findings of the included studies correlating dysphagia directly with ACDF 
procedures was calculated. Various established risk factors leading to dysphagia 
include the female sex, smoking, the surgical approach, rhBMP-2 use, and 
multilevel surgery, while zero-profile devices seem to reduce dysphagia risk. 
The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, especially 
prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. However, videofluoroscopic and endoscopic 
studies have been recently used for the evaluation of dysphagia. The role of 
local administration of steroids in the prevention of dysphagia has not yet been 
clarified. This review underscores the prevailing rudimentary understanding of 
the problem of dysphagia after ACDF procedures and highlights the need for more 
sensitive, factor-specific studies for understanding the impact of various risk 
factors on the incidence rate of dysphagia.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies show a high risk of developing malignancy in patients 
with Fanconi anemia. The most common solid tumor in this condition is head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and there is often uncertainty and about 
disease behavior as well as chemotherapy and radiation response.
OBJECTIVES: To describe and characterize HNSCC among Fanconi anemia patients on 
the Israeli Fanconi Registry.
METHODS: Our study population included patients in Israel's inherited bone 
marrow failure registry who were diagnosed with Fanconi anemia between1980 and 
2016. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from patient 
charts.
RESULTS: From the collected data, HNSCC was confirmed in 6/111 (5.4%) Fanconi 
anemia patients; 1 (17%) had classic HNSCC risk factors of tobacco abuse and 4 
(56%) had undergone primary surgery. The 3 (50%) receiving concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy had mild side effects, while half developed metachronous 
primary malignancy, and all developed > 2 primary malignancies. The overall 
median survival of the patients in our study was 14 (0.5-57) months.
CONCLUSIONS: Fanconi anemia patients have a very high risk of developing HNSCC. 
Proactive screening for malignancies is needed for the head and neck regions. We 
also found that chemoradiotherapy can be used safely in high-stage cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Identifying patients at risk of increased health care resource 
utilization is a valuable opportunity to develop targeted preoperative and 
perioperative interventions. In the present investigation, we sought to examine 
patient sociodemographic factors that predict prolonged length of stay (LOS) 
after traumatic spine fracture.
METHODS: We performed a cohort analysis using the National Trauma Data Bank 
tabulated during 2012-2016. Eligible patients were those who were diagnosed with 
cervical or thoracic spine fracture with spinal cord injury and who were treated 
surgically. We evaluated the effects of sociodemographic as well as psychosocial 
variables on LOS by negative binomial regression and adjusted for injury 
severity, injury mechanism, and hospital characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified 3856 eligible patients with a median LOS of 9 days 
(interquartile range, 6-15 days). Patients in older age categories, who were 
male (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.01-1.09), black (IRR, 1.12; CI, 1.05-1.19) or Hispanic (IRR, 1.09; CI, 
1.03-1.16), insured by Medicaid (IRR, 1.24; CI, 1.17-1.31), or had a diagnosis 
of alcohol use disorder (IRR, 1.12; CI, 1.06-1.18) were significantly more 
likely to have a longer LOS. In addition, patients with severe injury on Injury 
Severity Score (IRR, 1.32; CI, 1.14-1.53) and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
scores (GCS score 3-8, IRR, 1.44; CI, 1.35-1.55; GCS score 9-11, IRR, 1.40; CI, 
1.25-1.58) on admission had a significantly lengthier LOS. Patients admitted to 
a hospital in the Southern United States (IRR, 1.09; CI, 1.05-1.14) had longer 
LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic factors such as race, insurance status, and alcohol 
use disorder were associated with a prolonged LOS after surgical management of 
traumatic spine fracture with spinal cord injury.

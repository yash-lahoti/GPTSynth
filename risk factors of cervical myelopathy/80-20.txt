At a time when complex diseases affect globally 280 million people and claim 14 
million lives every year, there is an urgent need to rapidly increase our 
knowledge into their underlying etiologies. Though critical in identifying the 
people at risk, the causal environmental factors (microbiome and/or pollutants) 
and the affected pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. Herein, 
we consider the variations of autophagy-related (ATG) genes at the heart of 
mechanisms of increased susceptibility to environmental stress. A comprehensive 
autophagy genomic resource is presented with 263 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) for 69 autophagy-related genes associated with 117 autoimmune, 
inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and 
endocrine diseases. We thus propose the term 'autophagopathies' to group 
together a class of complex human diseases the etiology of which lies in a 
genetic defect of the autophagy machinery, whether directly related or not to an 
abnormal flux in autophagy, LC3-associated phagocytosis, or any associated 
trafficking. The future of precision medicine for common diseases will lie in 
our ability to exploit these ATG SNP x environment relationships to develop new 
polygenetic risk scores, new management guidelines, and optimal therapies for 
afflicted patients.Abbreviations: ATG, autophagy-related; ALS-FTD, amyotrophic

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often causes cervical spine lesions as the 
disease condition progresses, which induce occipital neuralgia or cervical 
myelopathy requiring surgical interventions. Meanwhile, patients with RA are 
susceptible to infection or other complications in the perioperative period 
because they frequently have comorbidities and use immunosuppressive 
medications. However, the risk factors or characteristics of patients with RA 
who experience perioperative complications after cervical spine surgery remain 
unknown. A risk factor analysis of perioperative complications in patients with 
RA who underwent primary cervical spine surgery was conducted in the present 
study.
METHODS: A total of 139 patients with RA who underwent primary cervical spine 
surgery from January 2001 to March 2020 were retrospectively investigated. Age 
and height, weight, serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS), Charlson comorbidity index, 
medications used, cervical spine lesion, surgery time, bleeding volume, and 
procedures were collected from medical records to compare the patients with 
complications to those without complications after surgery. The risk factors for 
perioperative complications were assessed by univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (20.1%) had perioperative complications. 
Perioperative complications were significantly associated with the following 
factors [data presented as odds ratio]: lower height [0.928, p=0.007], higher 
ASA-PS [2.296, p=0.048], longer operation time [1.013, p=0.003], more bleeding 
volume [1.004, p=0.04], higher rates of vertical subluxation [2.914, p=0.015] 
and subaxial subluxation (SAS) [2.507, p=0.036], occipito-cervical (OC) fusion 
[3.438, p=0.023], and occipito-cervical/thoracic (long) fusion [8.021, p=0.002] 
in univariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, lower height [0.915, p=0.005], 
higher ASA-PS [2.622, p=0.045] and long fusion [7.289, p=0.008] remained risk 
factors. High-dose prednisolone use [1.247, p=0.028], SAS [6.413, p=0.018], OC 
fusion [17.93, p=0.034], and long fusion [108.1, p<0.001] were associated with 
severe complications.
CONCLUSIONS: ASA-PS and long fusion could be indicators predicting perioperative 
complications in patients with RA after cervical spine surgery. In addition, 
cervical spine lesions requiring OC fusion or long fusion and high-dose 
prednisolone use were suggested to be risk factors for increasing severe 
complications.

INTRODUCTION: While spinal cord stimulator implant is an increasingly safe 
procedure, one of the most feared complications is spinal cord injury. Still, 
literature regarding its incidence remains highly variable. This retrospective 
analysis aims to evaluate the incidence of spinal cord injury after spinal cord 
stimulator implant using a large-scale claims database.
METHODS: The PearlDiver-Mariner database of national all payer claims was used 
to identify patients who underwent spinal cord stimulator implant (percutaneous 
or paddle) and developed subsequent spinal cord injury within 45 days. The 
primary outcome was to determine the overall incidence of spinal cord injury 
after spinal cord stimulator implant. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation 
of potential factors associated with developing spinal cord injury using 
univariable and multivariable regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 71,172 patients who underwent a spinal cord stimulator 
implant were included in the analysis, of which 52,070 underwent percutaneous 
and 19,102 underwent paddle spinal cord stimulator lead implant. The overall 
incidence of spinal cord injury after spinal cord stimulator implant (any lead 
type) was found to be 0.42% (302 patients). The incidence of spinal cord injury 
after percutaneous and paddle lead implants did not differ at 0.45% (233 
patients) and 0.36% (69 patients)(p=0.12), respectively. Overall, variables 
associated with a significantly increased OR (95% confidence interval) of 
developing spinal cord injury included male gender by 1.31 times (1.04 to 
1.65)(p=0.02); having a claim for low molecular weight heparin within 30 days by 
3.99 times (1.47 to 10.82)(p<0.01); a diagnosis for osteoporosis within 1 year 
by 1.75 times (1.15 to 2.66)(p<0.01); and a diagnosis of cervical or thoracic 
spinal canal stenosis within 1 year by 1.99 (1.37 to 2.90)(p<0.001) and 4.00 
(2.63 to 6.09)(p<0.0001) times, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support the notion that spinal cord stimulator 
implant continues to be a safe procedure for chronic pain patients. However, 
risk factor mitigation strategies for the prevention of spinal cord injury after 
spinal cord stimulator implant should be undertaken prior to performing the 
procedure.

of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) parameters in patients with high cervical spinal myeloma and the 
evaluation of postoperative spinal cord function.
METHODS: In recent years, 42 patients with high cervical spine myeloma were 
selected as the observation group, and 42 healthy volunteers were selected as 
the control group during the same period. The apparent dispersion coefficient 
(ADC), the fractional anisotropy (FA), the number of fiber bundles (FT), and the 
fiber bundle ratio (FTR) were compared between the two groups. The correlation 
between the ADC, FA, FT, FTR, and the International Standard for Neurological 
Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) score in the observation group 
were analyzed. Spinal cord function was evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association Score (JOA). Logistic regression model was used to analyze the 
factors affecting the recovery of spinal cord function after surgery. The 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the value of 
ADC, FA, FT, FTR1, and FTR2 in predicting the recovery of spinal cord function.
RESULTS: The ADCs of the lesion layer and lower layer of the observation group 
were higher than the middle and lower layers of the control group, the FA and FT 
were lower than the middle and lower layers of the control group, and FTR1 and 
FTR2 were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The ADC of the 
lesion layer in the observation group was negatively correlated with ISNCSCI 
score, and the FA, FT, FTR1, FTR2, and ISNCSCI scores were positively correlated 
(P < 0.05). Three months after the operation, JOA was used to evaluate the 
spinal cord function, which was excellent in 23 cases and poor in 19 cases. 
Logistic regression model analysis showed that after the ISNCSCI score was 
controlled, the increase in ADC and the decrease in FA, FT, FTR1, and FTR2 of 
the lesion layer were independent risk factors for poor postoperative body 
function recovery (P < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that the combination of ADC, 
FA, FT, FTR1, and FTR2 of the lesion layer predicted the AUC of spinal cord 
functional recovery was 0.941, which was better than the single prediction (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: The abnormal DTI parameter values of patients with high cervical 
spinal myeloma can better reflect the lack of spinal cord function, and they can 
effectively predict the recovery of the patient's body function after surgery, 
providing a reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the sagittal radiological parameters related to clinical 
recovery of patients with acute traumatic central cord syndrome (ATCCS) and 
determine the diagnostic value of related variables.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 104 patients with ATCCS. Six 
cervical sagittal balance parameters were collected: Cobb angle, T1 slope, neck 
tilt, thoracic inlet angle (TIA), C2-C7 sagittal vertex axis, T1 slope - C2-C7 
Cobb angle. The patients were assigned to an ideal improvement group and poor 
improvement group according to their recovery rate. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to evaluate the 
significant results of logistic regression and the optimal diagnostic value.
RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores 
indicated a good recovery after surgical intervention. Radiological findings 
revealed that neck tilt and TIA were risk factors for poor neurological 
improvement of patients with ATCCS. Area under the curve (95% confidence 
interval) values of neck tilt and TIA were 0.763 (0.660-0.866) and 0.749 
(0.643-0.855), and cutoff values were 39.1° and 65.6°, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower neck tilt and TIA are risk factors for poor outcomes in 
patients with ATCCS after surgery. Neck tilt <39° and TIA <66° had significant 
diagnostic value for poor prognosis.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of caudal instrumentation level on revision 
rates following posterior cervical laminectomy and fusion.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was 
performed. Minimum follow-up was one year. Patients were divided into two groups 
based on the caudal level of their index fusion construct (Group 1-cervical and 
Group 2- thoracic). Reoperation rates were compared between the two groups, and 
preoperative demographics and radiographic parameters were compared between 
patients who required revision and those who did not. Multivariate binomial 
regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for 
revision surgery.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven (137/204) patients received fusion constructs 
that terminated at C7 (Group 1), while 67 (67/204) received fusion constructs 
that terminated at T1 or T2 (Group 2). The revision rate was 8.33% in the 
combined cohort, 7.3% in Group 1, and 10.4% in Group 2. There was no significant 
difference in revision rates between the 2 groups (P = .43). Multivariate 
regression analysis did not identify any independent risk factors for revision 
surgery.
CONCLUSION: This study shows no evidence of increased risk of revision in 
patients with fusion constructs terminating in the cervical spine when compared 
to patients with constructs crossing the cervicothoracic junction. These 
findings support terminating the fusion construct proximal to the 
cervicothoracic junction when indicated.

University, No. 6 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, China.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative 
complications and clinical efficacy of patients with cervical spondylosis with 
spinal cord compression (CSWSCC) with or without MRI T2WIHS (T2-weighted image 
high signal) by means of propensity matching score grouping.
METHODS: We analyzed a single-center data of 913 surgical patients with CSWSCC 
by propensity matching score in this study, of which 326 patients had 
preoperative cervical MRI T2WIHS. The patient's general condition and 
perioperative indicators were collected. The MRI T2WIHS and normal groups were 
paired 1 : 1 to eliminate selection bias by propensity matching score. Finally, 
a total of 312 pairs were matched successfully. The results of perioperative 
complications and other outcome variables were compared between the two groups 
by Cox function analysis.
RESULTS: The postoperative blood loss, operation time, blood transfusion volume, 
systemic complications, local complications, volume of drainage, abnormal use of 
antibiotic, length of hospital stay, and JOA (Japanese Orthopaedic Association) 
improvement rate were analyzed. As the only complication with significant 
statistical difference, the incidence of IRI (ischemia-reperfusion injury) in 
patients with MRI T2WIHS was significantly higher. The length of hospital stay 
was more significantly increased in patients with MRI T2WIHS; on the contrary, 
the JOA improvement rate decreased significantly.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that there was no significant difference in the 
incidence of perioperative complications in CSWSCC patients with or without MRI 
T2WIHS, except for the IRI. Moreover, the JOA improvement rate of patients 
without MRI T2WIHS was significantly better, with the length of hospital stay 
reduced.

BACKGROUND: Despite the advances in anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion 
(ACCF) as a reconstructive surgical technique, the rate of complications related 
to artificial implants remains high. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the long-term clinical course of ACCF with tantalum trabecular metal 
(TTM)-lordotic implants. Focus is placed on the relevance and influence of 
implant subsidence on sagittal alignment and the related clinical implications.
METHODS: Retrospective, observational study of prospectively collected outcomes 
including 56 consecutive patients with degenerative cervical disc disease 
(myelopathy and/or radiculopathy). All patients underwent 1-level or 2-level 
ACCF with TTM-lordotic implants. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.85 years.
RESULTS: The fusion rate at the end of follow-up was 98.11% (52/53). Implant 
subsidence occurred in 44 (83.01%) cases, including slight subsistence (<3 mm) 
in 37 (69.81%) and severe subsidence (>3 mm) in 7 cases (13.2%). The greatest 
degree of subsidence developed in the first 3 months postoperatively (P = 
0.003). No patients presented a significant increase in implant subsidence 
beyond the second year of follow-up. The most common site of severe subsidence 
was the anterior region of the cranial end plate (4/7). At the end of follow-up, 
C1-C7 lordosis and segmental-Cobb angle of the fused segment increased on 
average by 5.06 ± 8.26 and 1.98 ± 6.02 degrees, respectively, though this 
difference failed to reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). Visual analog 
scale and Neck Disability Index scores improved at the conclusion of follow-up 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: ACCF with anterior cervical reconstruction using TTM-lordotic 
implants and anterior cervical plating for treatment of cervical degenerative 
disease has high fusion rates and good clinical outcome. The osteoconductive 
properties of TTM provide immediate stabilization and eliminate the need for 
bone grafts to ensure solid bone fusion. Before fusion occurs, asymptomatic 
implant settlement into the vertebral body is inevitable. However, lack of 
parallelism and reduced contact surface between the implant and the vertebral 
end plate are major risk factors for severe further subsidence, which may 
negatively affect the clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify functional outcomes of facet joint 
distraction (FJD) and identify specific risk factors for excessive FJD during 
single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 100 patients who underwent 
single-level ACDF for CSM from January 2016 to May 2020. Anteroposterior and 
lateral radiographs were obtained before surgery and 12 months after surgery. 
Radiographic parameters including anterior intervertebral height (AIH), 
posterior intervertebral height, facet joint gap, cage posterior depth (CPD), 
upper vertebral length, cervical segmental Cobb angle (CSCA), C2-C7 Cobb angle, 
and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis were analyzed. Functional outcomes were 
evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association Score, visual 
analog scale (VAS), and Neck Disability Index (NDI).
RESULTS: Comparison between the appropriate FJD and excessive FJD groups showed 
statistically significant differences in the NDI, VAS, CPD, and ΔAIH (P < 0.05). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that independent factors 
associated with excessive FJD were as follows: a ΔAIH > 2.28 mm (odds ratio 
[OR] = 6.792, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.885-24.470, P = 0.003), CPD 
> 12.45 mm (OR = 5.876, 95% CI = 1.828-18.895, P = 0.003), and post-CSCA < 0° 
(OR = 6.251, 95% CI = 1.275-30.633, P = 0.024). Furthermore, receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis for the multilevel logistic regression model 
produced an area under the curve of 0.783 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with an FJD of >0.905 mm had worse NDI and VAS pain scores, 
but not a poorer modified Japanese Orthopedic Association Score recovery rate. 
Our findings suggested that a ΔAIH > 2.28 mm, CPD > 12.45 mm, and post-CSCA < 0° 
were independent risk factors for excessive FJD after single-level ACDF for CSM.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a classification and regression tree (CART) model to 
predict the need of tracheostomy in patients with traumatic cervical spinal cord 
injury (TCSCI) and to quantify scores of risk factors to make individualized 
clinical assessments.
METHODS: The clinical characteristics of patients with TCSCI admitted to our 
hospital from January 2014 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The 
demographic characteristics (gender, age, smoking history), mechanism of injury, 
injury characteristics (ASIA impairment grades, neurological level of 
impairment, injury severity score), preexisting lung disease and preexisting 
medical conditions were statistically analyzed. The risk factors of tracheostomy 
were analyzed by univariate logistic regression analysis (ULRA) and multiple 
logistic regression analysis (MLRA). The CART model was established to predict 
tracheostomy.
RESULTS: Three hundred and forty patients with TCSCI met the inclusion criteria, 
in which 41 patients underwent the tracheostomy. ULRA and MLRA showed that 
age > 50, ISS > 16, NLI > C5 and AIS A were significantly associated with 
tracheostomy. The CART model showed that AIS A and NLI > C5 were at the first 
and second decision node, which had a significant influence on the decision of 
tracheostomy. The final scores for tracheostomy from CART algorithm, composed of 
age, ISS, NLI and AIS A with a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.96, 
could also predict tracheostomy.
CONCLUSION: The establishment of CART model provided a certain clinical guidance 
for the prediction of tracheostomy in TCSCI. Quantifications of risk factors 
enable accurate prediction of individual patient risk of need for tracheostomy.

PURPOSE: To explore clinical and dosimetric predictors of acute hematologic 
toxicity (HT) in cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy 
and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 184 
cervical cancer patients who had concurrent chemotherapy and VMAT. Hematological 
parameters were collected during the treatment period. The total pelvic bone 
(TPB) was delineated retrospectively for dose-volume calculations. To compare 
the differences between two groups, the normality test findings were used to run 
a paired-samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Pearson's correlation 
analysis or Spearman's correlation was used to testing the correlation between 
the two variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to analyze 
associations between HT and possible risk factors. The receiver operating 
characteristic curve(ROC) was used to evaluate the best cut-off point for 
dosimetric planning constraints.
RESULTS: The nadir of absolute monocyte count (AMC) was found to be positively 
correlated with the nadir of absolute white blood cells (WBC) count (r = 0.5378, 
95% CI 0.4227-0.6357, P < 0.0001) and the nadir of absolute neutrophil 
count(ANC) (r = 0.5000, 95% CI 0.3794-0.6039, P < 0.0001). The AMC decreased and 
increased before the ANC and WBC. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
the chemotherapy regimens and the TPB_V20 were independent risk factors for 
developing grade ≥ 3 HT. The optimal TPB_V20 cut-off value identified by ROC 
curves and the Youden test was 71% (AUC = 0.788; 95% CI 0.722-0.845; P 
value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The changing trend of AMC can be used as an effective predictor for 
the timing and severity of the ANC/WBC nadirs and prophylactic G-CSF 
administration. Maintain TPB_V20 < 71% and selecting single-agent cisplatin or 
carboplatin could significantly reduce grade ≥ 3 HT in cervical cancer patients 
undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 2532 adults who underwent elective surgery 
for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy with intraoperative neuromonitoring 
(IONM) with motor evoked potentials (MEPs) between 2017 and 2019.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate attainability of monitorable MEPs across demographic, health 
history, and patient-reported outcomes measure (PROM) factors.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: When baseline IONM responses cannot be obtained, the 
value of IONM on mitigating the risk of postoperative deficits is marginalized 
and a clinical decision to proceed must be made based, in part, on the 
differential diagnosis of the unmonitorable MEPs. Despite known associations 
with baseline MEPs and anesthetic regimen or preoperative motor strength, little 
is known regarding associations with other patient factors.
METHODS: Demographics, health history, and PROM data were collected 
preoperatively. MEP baseline responses were reported as monitorable or 
unmonitorable at incision. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds 
of having at least one unmonitorable MEP from demographic and health history 
factors.
RESULTS: Age [odds ratio (OR)=1.031, P <0.001], sex (male OR=1.572, P =0.007), a 
primary diagnosis of myelopathy (OR=1.493, P =0.021), peripheral vascular 
disease (OR=2.830, P =0.009), type II diabetes (OR=1.658, P =0.005), and 
hypertension (OR=1.406, P =0.040) were each associated with increased odds of 
unmonitorable MEPs from one or more muscles; a history of thyroid disorder was 
inversely related (OR=0.583, P =0.027). P atients with unmonitorable MEPs 
reported less neck-associated disability and pain ( P <0.036), but worse SF-12 
physical health and lower extremity (LE) and upper extremity function ( P 
<0.016). Compared with radiculopathy, unmonitorable MEPs in myelopathy patients 
more often involved LE muscles. Cord function was monitorable in 99.1% of 
myelopathic patients with no reported LE dysfunction and no history of 
hypertension or diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Myelopathy, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, 
and/or symptomatic LE dysfunction increased the odds of having unmonitorable 
baseline MEPs. Unmonitorable baseline MEPs was uncommon in patients without 
significant LE weakness, even in the presence of myelopathy.

STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review.
OBJECTIVES: To discuss the current understanding of the natural history of 
degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
METHODS: Literature review summarizing current evidence pertaining to the 
natural history and risk factors of DCM.
RESULTS: DCM is a common condition in which progressive arthritic disease of the 
cervical spine leads to spinal cord compression resulting in a constellation of 
neurological symptoms, in particular upper extremity dysfunction and gait 
impairment. Anatomical factors including cord-canal mismatch, congenitally fused 
vertebrae and genetic factors may increase individuals' risk for DCM 
development. Non-myelopathic spinal cord compression (NMSCC) is a common 
phenomenon with a prevalence of 24.2% in the healthy population, and 35.3% among 
individuals >60 years of age. Clinical radiculopathy and/or electrophysiological 
signs of cervical cord dysfunction appear to be risk factors for myelopathy 
development. Radiological progression of incidental Ossification of the 
Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (OPLL) is estimated at 18.3% over 81-months and 
development of myelopathy ranges between 0-61.5% (follow-up ranging from 40 to 
124 months between studies) among studies. In patients with symptomatic DCM 
undergoing non-operative treatment, 20-62% will experience neurological 
deterioration within 3-6 years.
CONCLUSION: Current estimates surrounding the natural history of DCM, 
particularly those individuals with mild or minimal impairment, lack precision. 
Clear predictors of clinical deterioration for those treated with non-operative 
care are yet to be identified. Future studies are needed on this topic to help 
improve treatment counseling and clinical prognostication.

Objective: To determine the nationwide prevalence of malignant neoplasms 
(excluding hepatocellular carcinoma-HCC) in hospitalized liver transplant 
recipients and to study the hospital utilization, and mortality to the incidence 
of malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, few epidemiological studies 
addressed outcomes in post-liver transplant patients, such as the annual number 
of hospitalizations, mortality, patient characteristics regarding malignancies. 
Methods: NIS database was queried between 2016 and 2018 to retrieve records of 
patients admitted with a principal or secondary diagnosis of liver transplant 
following the International Classification of Diseases, tenth Revision (ICD-10). 
The population was divided into case and control groups according to the 
presence and absence of malignant neoplasm (MN) except for HCC. We also compared 
the incidence of MN in LTX patients and non-LTX matched cohort. Results: A total 
of 7.28% admissions were associated with malignant neoplasms (except HCC) in LTX 
patients. Lymphomas, respiratory, gastrointestinal (excluding HCC), leukemia, 
and head/neck were commonest cancers with estimated admission rates of 0.97%, 
0.90%, 0.80%, 0.53%, and 0.49%, respectively. Lung cancer was the most frequent 
malignant neoplasm among White and Black racial/ethnic groups (15.78% and 
14.8%), whereas lymphoma was pervasive among Hispanics (20.3%). Lung cancer had 
the highest in-hospital mortality (10.55%), followed by the cancer of the 
nervous system (9.09%). The LTX and non-LTX cohort comparison showed that LTX 
patients are at increased risk of head and neck cancers, skin cancers, 
lymphomas, tumors, and Myelodysplastic syndrome. According to a multivariate 
analysis, a statistically significant association existed between malignant 
neoplasms in LTX patients and the following factors: increasing age (P < .001), 
higher mortality (P < .001), females with 29% lesser odds than males (P < .001), 
Black race and Hispanic ethnicity with 20% and 26% lesser odds as compared to 
White (P < .05). Clinical factors included smoking, Alcoholic cirrhosis, 
Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, were statistically significant risk factors of 
post-liver transplantation malignancies. Conclusions: Malignancies were frequent 
among elderly patients and predominantly in males. Lymphoproliferative diseases 
were the most prevalent malignancy types, followed by respiratory/lung cancer- 
which showed the highest mortality risk of all cancers. LTX patients are at 
increased risk of head and neck cancers, skin cancers, lymphoma, tumors, and 
Myelodysplastic syndrome compared to non-LTX patients.

The appearance of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery may be suggest the 
possibility of atherosclerosis in the spinal cord artery, which can cause spinal 
cord ischemia and further lead to neural element damage.According to the 
inclusion and exclude standard, there are 137 patients with cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy (CSM) incorporating retrospective analysis. These patients were 
consecutively admitted into The Second Hospital- Cheeloo College of 
Medicine-Shandong University from January 2016 to December 2018 and have 
accepted surgical treatment. All patients were examined by color Doppler 
ultrasound to detect carotid atherosclerosis before surgery. All patients were 
divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of carotid 
atherosclerosis: carotid atherosclerosis group (n = 88) and noncarotid 
atherosclerosis group (n = 49). All patients were followed up for at least 
12 months after surgery. Demographic and surgery-related data were collected and 
analyzed to identify potential factors that affect the surgical outcomes in 
CSM.The average age of carotid atherosclerosis group (51 males and 37 females), 
and noncarotid atherosclerosis group (24 males and 25 females) were 
62.02 ± 10.34 years (range, 38-85 years) and 49.61 ± 10.28 years (range, 
26-67 years), respectively.In carotid atherosclerosis group: pre and 
postoperative modify Japanese Orthopedic Association Scores (mJOA score) were 
11.58 ± 1.82 and 14.36 ± 1.64; the recovery rate of mJOA score was 
45.57% ± 13.28%. In noncarotid atherosclerosis group: pre and postoperative mJOA 
score were 12.00 ± 2.11 and 15.04 ± 1.70; the recovery rate of mJOA score was 
53.90% ± 13.22%. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that 
gender (P = .004), age ≥65 years (P = .001), duration of symptoms ≥12 months 
(P = .040), smoking history (P < .001), preoperative mJOA score ≤11 (P = .007) 
and carotid atherosclerosis (P = .004) were related to poor surgical outcomes. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed significant correlations 
between poor surgical outcomes and age ≥65 years (P = .047), smoking history 
(P = .010), preoperative mJOA score ≤11 (P = .008) or carotid atherosclerosis 
(P = .047).Carotid atherosclerosis may be a risk factor for poor surgical 
outcomes in CSM.

OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the incidence and risk factors for pneumonia after 
acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: Spinal injuries center in 
Japan.Participants: Of 184 individuals who were admitted within 2 weeks after 
acute traumatic cervical spinal injuries, 167 individuals who met the criteria 
were included in this study.Interventions: The occurrence of pneumonia, degree 
of dysphagia using the Dysphagia Severity Scale, patient age, history of 
smoking, presence of tracheostomy, vital capacity, level of injury, and the 
American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) 2 weeks after injury 
were assessed.Outcomes: Incidence of pneumonia were analyzed. Moreover, the risk 
factors of pneumonia were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: From the 167 individuals who met the criteria, 30 individuals (18%) had 
pneumonia; in 26 (87%) of these individuals, pneumonia was aspiration related, 
defined as Dysphagia Severity Scale ≤ 4. The median occurrence of aspiration 
pneumonia was 11.5 days after injury. A logistic regression analysis revealed 
that severe AIS and severe Dysphagia Severity Scale scores were significant risk 
factors of pneumonia after CSCI.
CONCLUSIONS: It was highly likely that the pneumonias following CSCI were 
related to aspiration based on the Dysphagia Severity Scale. In addition, most 
of the patients developed aspiration pneumonia within 1 month after injury. 
Aspiration and severe paralysis were significant risk factors for pneumonia. The 
treatment of dysphagia in the acute phase should be considered an important 
indicator to prevent pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE: Combinations of certain social risk factors of race, sex, education, 
socioeconomic status (SES), insurance, education, employment, and one's housing 
situation have been associated with poorer pain and disability outcomes after 
lumbar spine surgery. To date, an exploration of such factors in patients with 
cervical spine surgery has not been conducted. The objective of the current work 
was to 1) define the social risk phenotypes of individuals who have undergone 
cervical spine surgery for myelopathy and 2) analyze their predictive capacity 
toward disability, pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction-based 
outcomes.
METHODS: The Cervical Myelopathy Quality Outcomes Database was queried for the 
period from January 2016 to December 2018. Race/ethnicity, educational 
attainment, SES, insurance payer, and employment status were modeled into unique 
social phenotypes using latent class analyses. Proportions of social groups were 
analyzed for demonstrating a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 
30% from baseline for disability, neck and arm pain, quality of life, and 
patient satisfaction at the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups.
RESULTS: A total of 730 individuals who had undergone cervical myelopathy 
surgery were included in the final cohort. Latent class analysis identified 2 
subgroups: 1) high risk (non-White race and ethnicity, lower educational 
attainment, not working, poor insurance, and predominantly lower SES), n = 268, 
36.7% (class 1); and 2) low risk (White, employed with good insurance, and 
higher education and SES), n = 462, 63.3% (class 2). For both 3-month and 1-year 
outcomes, the high-risk group (class 1) had decreased odds (all p < 0.05) of 
attaining an MCID score in disability, neck/arm pain, and health-related quality 
of life. Being in the low-risk group (class 2) resulted in an increased odds of 
attaining an MCID score in disability, neck/arm pain, and health-related quality 
of life. Neither group had increased or decreased odds of being satisfied with 
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although 2 groups underwent similar surgical approaches, the social 
phenotype involving non-White race/ethnicity, poor insurance, lower SES, and 
poor employment did not meet MCIDs for a variety of outcome measures. This 
finding should prompt surgeons to proactively incorporate socially conscience 
care pathways within healthcare systems, as well as to optimize community-based 
resources to improve outcomes and personalize care for populations at social 
risk.

Objective: To evaluate the association between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) and potential environmental risk factors, especially head traumas and 
pesticides, in two populations from Canada and France.Methods: A case-control 
study was performed in tertiary-care centers. Consecutive ALS cases were 
recruited along with a control group from the same age distribution and region. 
Participants answered a phone-administered questionnaire. Head trauma exposure 
was censored at age of symptom onset, and a sensitivity analysis considering old 
head traumas that occurred more than 3 years before onset was performed. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to estimate odds 
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: A total of 404 
ALS cases and 381 controls completed the questionnaire. Previous head trauma was 
more frequently reported by cases (adjusted OR 1.50 (1.05-2.18)) with a 
dose-response relationship. This association was driven by a strong effect in 
men (adjusted OR 2.06 (1.22-3.55)) and was consistent for old traumas, but there 
was no association in women. For pesticides, a previous high-risk occupation was 
associated with ALS (adjusted OR 2.08 (1.36-3.24)), although reported 
occupational exposure to pesticides was not statistically significant in the 
multivariate model (adjusted OR 1.67 (0.97-2.97)). Past electrocution was 
associated with ALS (adjusted OR 1.79 (CI 1.13-2.87)), especially spinal-onset 
ALS. Residential exposure to pesticides, neck trauma, and welding were not 
associated with ALS.Conclusions: Head trauma is a risk factor for ALS in men 
only. Previous occupation at high risk for pesticides exposure and electrocution 
are also risk factors for ALS.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) has become popular in recent years, and 
cognitive decline is a common complication. Adiponectin is a common protein 
hormone involved in the course of many diseases, but its relationship with SCI 
has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of our prospective study is to explore 
whether adiponectin can be used as a biomarker of cognitive decline in SCI.
METHODS: A total of 64 healthy volunteers and 92 patients with acute SCI were 
recruited by us. Serum adiponectin levels, demographic data (age and gender), 
lifestyle (smoking and drinking), medical history (diabetes and hypertension), 
and clinical baseline data (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, 
and fasting blood glucose) were recorded. Three months after enrollment, we used 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate cognitive function. Based 
on a quarter of the serum adiponectin levels, SCI patients were divided into 4 
groups, and the differences in their MoCA scores were compared. In addition, we 
used multivariate linear regression to predict the risk factors of the MoCA 
score.
RESULTS: The serum adiponectin level (6.1 ± 1.1 μg/ml) of SCI patients was 
significantly lower than that of the healthy control group (6.7 ± 0.9 μg/ml), 
and there was a significant difference between the two (p < 0.001). The group 
with higher serum adiponectin levels after 3 months of spinal cord injury had 
higher MoCA scores. Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum 
adiponectin level is a protective factor for cognitive function after SCI (β = 
0.210, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin levels can be used as an independent predictor of 
cognitive function in patients with acute SCI.

OBJECTIVE: High-impact chronic pain (HICP) is a recently proposed metric that 
indicates the presence of a severe and troubling pain-related condition. Surgery 
for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is designed to halt disease transition 
independent of chronic pain status. To date, the prevalence of HICP in 
individuals with CSM and their HICP transition from presurgery is unexplored. 
The authors sought to define HICP prevalence, transition, and outcomes in 
patients with CSM who underwent surgery and identify predictors of these HICP 
transition groups.
METHODS: CSM surgical recipients were categorized as HICP at presurgery and 3 
months if they exhibited pain that lasted 6-12 months or longer with at least 
one major activity restriction. HICP transition groups were categorized and 
evaluated for outcomes. Multivariate multinomial modeling was used to predict 
HICP transition categorization.
RESULTS: A majority (56.1%) of individuals exhibited HICP preoperatively; this 
value declined to 15.9% at 3 months (71.6% reduction). The presence of HICP was 
also reflective of other self-reported outcomes at 3 and 12 months, as most 
demonstrated notable improvement. Higher severity in all categories of 
self-reported outcomes was related to a continued HICP condition at 3 months. 
Both social and biological factors predicted HICP translation, with social 
factors being predominant in transitioning to HICP (from none preoperatively).
CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals who received CSM surgery changed HICP status at 3 
months. In a surgical population where decisions are based on disease 
progression, most of the changed status went from HICP preoperatively to none at 
3 months. Both social and biological risk factors predicted HICP transition 
assignment.

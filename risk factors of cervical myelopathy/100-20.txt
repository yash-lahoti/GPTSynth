Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, 
the founding member of a class of disorders known as ribosomopathies. Most cases 
result from loss of function mutations or deletions in 1 of 23 genes encoding 
either a small or large subunit-associated ribosomal protein (RP), resulting in 
RP haploinsufficiency. DBA is characterized by red cell hypoplasia or aplasia, 
poor linear growth and congenital anomalies. Small case series and case reports 
demonstrate DBA to be a cancer predisposition syndrome. Recent analyses from the 
Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry of North America (DBAR) have quantified the 
cancer risk in DBA. These studies reveal the most prevalent solid tumor, 
presenting in young adults and in children and adolescents, to be colorectal 
cancer (CRC) and osteogenic sarcoma, respectively. Of concern is that these 
cancers are typically detected at an advanced stage in patients who, because of 
their constitutional bone marrow failure, may not tolerate full-dose 
chemotherapy. Thus, the inability to provide optimal therapy contributes to poor 
outcomes. CRC screening in individuals over the age of 50 years, and now 45 
years, has led to early detection and significant improvements in outcomes for 
non-DBA patients with CRC. These screening and surveillance strategies have been 
adapted to detect familial early onset CRC. With the recognition of DBA as a 
moderately penetrant cancer risk syndrome a rational screening and surveillance 
strategy will be implemented. The downstream molecular events, resulting from RP 
haploinsufficiency and leading to cancer, are the subject of significant 
scientific inquiry.

This prospective multicenter study, established by the Japanese Ministry of 
Health, Labour and Welfare and involving 27 institutions, aimed to compare 
postoperative outcomes between laminoplasty (LM) and posterior fusion (PF) for 
cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), in order to 
address the controversy surrounding the role of instrumented fusion in cases of 
posterior surgical decompression for OPLL. 478 patients were considered for 
participation in the study; from among them, 189 (137 and 52 patients with LM 
and PF, respectively) were included and evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association (JOA) scores, the JOA Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire 
(JOACMEQ), and radiographical measurements. Basic demographic and radiographical 
data were reviewed, and the propensity to choose a surgical procedure was 
calculated. Preoperatively, there were no significant differences among the 
participants in terms of patient backgrounds, radiographical measurements 
(K-line or cervical alignment on X-ray, OPLL occupation ratio on computed 
tomography, increased signal intensity change on magnetic resonance imaging), or 
clinical status (JOA score and JOACMEQ) after adjustments. The overall risk of 
perioperative complications was found to be lower with LM (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, 
p = 0.006), and the rate of C5 palsy occurrence was significantly lower with LM 
(OR 0.11, p = 0.0002) than with PF. The range of motion (20.91° ± 1.05° and 
9.38° ± 1.24°, p < 0.0001) in patients who had PF was significantly smaller than 
in those who had LM. However, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed 
no significant difference among the participants in JOA score, JOA recovery 
rate, or JOACMEQ improvement at two years. In contrast, OPLL progression was 
greater in the LM group than in the PF group (OR 2.73, p = 0.0002). Both LM and 
PF for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL had resulted in comparable postoperative 
outcomes at 2 years after surgery.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the surgical efficacy 
and risk factors of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients with 
increased signal intensity (ISI) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI-T2WI).
METHODS: We compared the surgical outcomes of CSM patients with and without ISI. 
In addition, we compared the efficacy of anterior and posterior cervical 
decompression in CSM patients with ISI. We also analyzed the risk factors of 
MRI-T2WI ISI in CSM patients.
RESULTS: The incidence of ISI among 153 CSM patients was 71.89 %. The JOA score 
and JOA remission rate were better in the ISI-free than in the ISI group. The 
postoperative JOA score and JOA remission rate were better in the posterior than 
the anterior approach surgery group. The disease duration and vertebral canal 
volume were found to be risk factors for ISI in CSM patients.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with CSM, the prognosis is worse for those with ISI 
than those without ISI. Posterior cervical decompression surgery produces a 
better curative effect than anterior cervical decompression surgery in CSM 
patients with ISI. CSM patients with longer disease duration and small vertebral 
canal volume should undergo surgical treatment as early as possible.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multi-center trial.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize the complication profile associated with modest 
systemic hypothermia after acute cervical SCI in a prospective multi-center 
study.
SETTING: Five trauma centers in the United States.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective, multi-center trial on the use of 
modest systemic hypothermia for acute cervical SCI. Patients with acute cervical 
SCI were assigned to receive modest systemic hypothermia (33 C) or standard of 
care medical treatment. Patients in the hypothermia group were cooled to 33 C 
and maintained at the target temperature for 48 h. Complication profile and the 
rate of complications within the first 6 weeks after injury were compared 
between the two groups. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine 
risk factors for complications after injury.
RESULTS: Fifty patients (hypothermia: 27, control: 23) were analyzed for this 
study. Median age was significantly lower in the hypothermia arm (39 vs 59 
years, p = 0.02). Respiratory complications were the most common (hypothermia: 
55.6% vs control: 52.2%, p = 0.81). The rate of deep vein thrombosis was not 
significantly different between the two groups (hypothermia: 14.8% vs control 
17.4%, p = 0.71). The rate of complications was not statistically different 
between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: In this prospective multi-center controlled trial, preliminary data 
show that modest systemic hypothermia was not associated with increased risk of 
complications within the first 6 weeks after acute cervical SCI.
TRIAL INFORMATION: The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov NCT02991690.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the underlying pathologies of 
non-rheumatic retro-odontoid pseudotumors (NRPs), which would help establish an 
appropriate surgical strategy for myelopathy caused by NRP.
METHODS: We identified 35 patients with myelopathy caused by NRP who underwent 
surgery between 2006 and 2017. An age- and sex-matched control group of 70 
subjects was selected from patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy. 
Radiographic risk factors for NRP were compared between cases and controls. We 
also assessed surgical outcomes following occipital-cervical (O-C) fusion, 
atlantoaxial (C1-2) fusion, or C1 laminectomy.
RESULTS: Patients with NRP had significantly lower C1 sagittal inner diameter, 
C2-7 range of motion (ROM), C2-7 Cobb angle, and C7 tilt, as well as 
significantly higher C1-2 ROM, atlantodental interval (ADI), and C1-2 to O-C7 
ROM ratio. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that ADI, C2-7 ROM, and C7 
tilt were independent risk factors for NRP. Neurological recovery and 
pseudotumor size reduction were comparable among surgical procedures, whereas 
post-operative cervical spine function was significantly lower in the O-C fusion 
group than in the other groups.
CONCLUSION: Non-rheumatic retro-odontoid pseudotumor was associated with an 
increase in ADI, suggesting that spinal arthrodesis surgery is a reasonable 
strategy for NRP. C1-2 fusion is preferable over O-C fusion because of the high 
prevalence of ankylosis in the subaxial cervical spine. Given that 29% of 
patients with NRP have C1 hypoplasia, such cases can be treated by posterior 
decompression alone. Our study highlights the need to select appropriate 
surgical procedures based on the underlying pathology in each case.

IMPORTANCE: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 
(GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality 
to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and 
territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer 
incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. 
Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of 
educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those 
younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 
million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) 
and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an 
estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these 
represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% 
UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase 
in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer 
was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of 
life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI 
quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to 
DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile 
to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had 
the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest 
number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage 
increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle 
SDI quintiles.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this systematic analysis suggest that 
the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by 
SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can 
potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the cut-off values of the spinal 
canal parameters as risk factors for C5 palsy after posterior cervical spine 
surgery with and without foraminotomy.
METHODS: One hundred three consecutive patients (67 males, 36 females; mean age 
= 66 years, age range = 27-87 years) with cervical myelopathy who underwent 
posterior cervical spine surgery at our institution were retrospectively 
reviewed and included in the study. The first consecutive 69 patients who 
underwent posterior cervical spine surgery with prophylactic bilateral C4/5 
foraminotomy were designated as the F (+) group. The subsequent 34 consecutive 
patients who underwent posterior cervical spine surgery without prophylactic 
bilateral C4/5 foraminotomy were designated as the F (-) group. All patients 
were then divided into four subgroups. In the F (+) group, patients with C5 
palsy were designated as the F (+) P (+) subgroup (n = 13), while those without 
C5 palsy were designated as the F (+) P (-) subgroup (n = 56). In the F (-) 
group, patients with C5 palsy were designated as the F (-) P (+) subgroup (n = 
5), while those without C5 palsy were designated as the F (-)P(-) subgroup (n = 
29). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to investigate the 
cut-off values of the spinal canal parameters for the development of 
postoperative C5 palsy. The assessed spinal parameters were the gutter positions 
(GP), laminar inclination angles (LIA), and postoperative cross-sectional areas 
(CSA) of the dural sac. The risk ratios (RR) of the spinal canal parameters as 
risk factors for C5 palsy were evaluated.
RESULTS: The incidence of C5 palsy was similar between the F (+) group (18.8%) 
and the F (-) group (14.7%). The cut-off values for each spinal canal parameter 
in the F (+) group (GP: 0.82-0.84, LIA: 58.9-62.4°, and CSA: 189.5-200 mm2 ) 
were similar to those in the F (-) group (0.81-0.89, 61.7-62.5°, and 197.5-199.5 
mm2, respectively). In the RR results for C5 palsy, the LIA was highest in both 
groups. The F (+) P (-) subgroup had significantly larger mean CSA at C4/5 and 
C5/6 (202.3 mm2 and 200.9 mm2, respectively) than the F (-)P(-) subgroup (177.3 
mm2 and 178.9 mm2, respectively) (P = 0.0181 and P = 0.0277, respectively). 
Prophylactic C4/5 foraminotomy did not specifically prevent postoperative C5 
palsy due to foraminal stenosis at C4/5.
CONCLUSION: C4/5 foraminotomy should not be recommended for avoidance of C5 
palsy. Although the bony spinal parameters were similar between the F (+) and F 
(-) groups, the CSA in the F (+) group was significantly than that in the F (-) 
group in the patients without C5 palsy.

IMPORTANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative 
disease; understanding ALS risk factors is a critical public health issue.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of and mortality from ALS in National 
Football League (NFL) athletes and to describe characteristics associated with 
ALS within this cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study included 
all 19 423 NFL athletes who debuted between 1960 and 2019 and played 1 or more 
professional game. It was conducted between October 3, 2020, and July 19, 2021.
EXPOSURE: Participation in the NFL, including playing 1 or more professional 
games.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cases of ALS and death information were identified 
based on public records from NFL statistics aggregators, news reports, 
obituaries, and National Death Index results. The standardized incidence ratio 
and the standardized mortality ratio were calculated based on data acquired from 
surveillance studies of ALS accounting for age, sex, and race. Secondary 
analyses examined the association of body mass index, NFL career duration, race, 
birth location, and markers of fame, using a nested case-control design, 
matching athletes with ALS to athletes without ALS, by NFL debut year.
RESULTS: A total of 19 423 male former and current NFL players (age range, 23-78 
years) were included in this cohort study and were followed up for a cumulative 
493 168 years (mean [SD] follow-up, 30.6 [13.7] years). Thirty-eight players 
received a diagnosis of ALS, and 28 died during the study time frame, 
representing a significantly higher incidence of ALS diagnosis (standardized 
incidence ratio, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.58-4.93) and mortality (standardized mortality 
ratio, 3.94; 95% CI, 2.62-5.69) among NFL players compared with the US male 
population, adjusting for age and race. Among NFL athletes, nested-case-control 
analyses found that those who received a diagnosis of ALS had significantly 
longer careers (mean [SD] duration, 7.0 [3.9] years) than athletes without ALS 
(mean [SD] duration, 4.5 [3.6] years; odds ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3). There 
were no differences in ALS status based on proxies of NFL fame, body mass index, 
position played, birth location, or race.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted incidence of and 
mortality from ALS among all NFL players who debuted between 1960 and 2019 were 
nearly 4 times as high as those of the general population. Athletes with a 
diagnosis of ALS had longer NFL careers than those without ALS, suggesting an 
association between NFL duration of play and ALS. The identification of these 
risk factors for ALS helps to inform the study of pathophysiological mechanisms 
responsible for this fatal neurodegenerative disease.

PURPOSE: International multi-professional expert consensus was sought to develop 
best practice recommendations for clinical management of patients following 
cervical spinal cord injury with oropharyngeal dysphagia and associated 
complications. Additionally, risk factors for dysphagia were identified to 
support the development of a screening tool.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-round Delphi study was undertaken with a 27-member 
panel of expert professionals in cervical spinal cord injury and complex 
dysphagia. They rated 85 statements across seven topic areas in round one, using 
a five-point Likert scale with a consensus set at 70%. Statements not achieving 
consensus were revised for the second round. Comparative group and individual 
feedback were provided at the end of each round.
RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for 50 (59%) statements in round one and a 
further 12 (48%) statements in round two. Recommendations for best practice were 
agreed for management of swallowing, respiratory function, communication, 
nutrition and oral care. Twelve risk factors for dysphagia were identified for 
components of a screening tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Best practice recommendations support wider clinical management to 
prevent complications and direct specialist care. Screening for risk factors 
allows early dysphagia identification with the potential to improve clinical 
outcomes. Further evaluation of the impact of these recommendations is 
needed.Implications for RehabilitationDysphagia is an added complication 
following cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) affecting morbidity, mortality and 
quality of life.Early identification of dysphagia risk allows focused 
interventions that reduce associated nutritional and respiratory 
impairments.Best practice recommendations based on expert consensus provide a 
baseline of appropriate interventions, in the absence of empirical evidence.A 
multi-professional approach to rehabilitation encourages a consistent and 
coordinated approach to care across acute and rehabilitation settings.

Patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) often exhibit symptoms in 
clinical practice, particularly the elderly, whose lower extremity functions are 
more likely to deteriorate; however, the underlying mechanisms currently remain 
unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the 
neurological severity of CSM based on an electrophysiological examination and 
radiological findings. Eighty-six patients with CSM were examined using 
kinematic CT myelography. The cross-sectional area of the spinal cord and 
dynamic changes in the spinal cord were measured at the affected level. The 
central motor conduction time (CMCT) using transcranial magnetic stimulation was 
calculated as follows: motor evoked potential latency - (compound muscle action 
potential latency + F latency - 1)/2 (ms). A multiple logistic regression 
analysis was performed to identify the radiological parameters associated with 
severe lower limb dysfunction. CMCT in the upper limbs correlated with spinal 
cord compression during neck extension, while that in the lower limbs correlated 
with a larger C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, cervical lordosis, a small C2-7 range 
of motion (ROM), and spinal cord compression during neck flexion. In a multiple 
logistic regression analysis, significant risk factors specific for severe lower 
limb dysfunction were greater anterior spondylolisthesis during neck extension 
(P = 0.006, OR: 2.53, 95%CI: 1.13-2.07) and small C2-7 ROM in neutral to flexion 
(P = 0.035, OR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.52-0.88). Imaging findings affect upper and lower 
extremity functions in specific manners. Cervical stiffness or anterior 
compression factors may be associated with the deterioration of lower limb 
function.

BACKGROUND: Acute cervical spinal cord injury (ACSCI) is commonly complicated by 
spinal shock, resulting in hemodynamic instability characterized by bradycardia 
and hypotension that can have fatal consequences. Current guidelines recommend 
the use of intravenous beta and dopamine agonists, such as norepinephrine and 
dopamine, respectively. We sought to determine whether enteral albuterol would 
be a safe and feasible treatment for bradycardia without an increase in the 
occurrence of known side effects of albuterol in patients with ACSCI.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with ACSCI admitted to an intensive 
care unit at a level I trauma center and treated with enteral albuterol was 
conducted. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: pure beta blocker 
use prior to injury, concurrent use of pacemaker, age of less than 18 years, or 
age more than 75 years. As part of the standard of care, all patients underwent 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) augmentation to reach a goal of greater than 85 mm 
Hg during the first 7 days post injury. All eligible patient charts were 
reviewed for demographic characteristics, daily minimum and maximum heart rate 
and MAP, and concomitant vasoactive medication use. Bradycardia and tachycardia 
were defined as heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm) and greater than 
100 bpm, respectively. Factors found to be associated with bradycardia on 
univariate analysis were entered into a multivariable generalized estimating 
equation analysis to determine factors independently associated with bradycardia 
during the study period.
RESULTS: There were 58 patients with cervical ASCI (age 45 ± 18 years, 76% men) 
admitted between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, that met the study 
criteria. The mean time to initiation of albuterol was 1.5 ± 1.7 days post 
injury, with a duration of 9.3 ± 4.5 days and a mean daily dosage of 
7.8 ± 4.5 mg. Bradycardia was observed in 136 of 766 patient days (17%). There 
were a few episodes of hyperglycemia (1%) and tachycardia (3%), but no episodes 
of hypokalemia. In a multivariable analysis, female sex (P = 0.006) and American 
Spinal Cord Injury Association grade A, B, or C (P < 0.001) were associated with 
a higher risk of developing bradycardia, whereas dosage of albuterol (P = 0.009) 
and norepinephrine use (P = 0.008) were associated with a lower risk of 
developing bradycardia.
CONCLUSIONS: Albuterol administration in ASCI is a safe and feasible treatment 
for bradycardia, given that no significant side effects, such as hyperglycemia, 
hypokalemia, or tachycardia, were observed. The administration of enteral 
albuterol was well tolerated and, in a dose-dependent manner, associated with a 
lower occurrence of bradycardia. Further prospective trials for the use of 
enteral albuterol after SCI are warranted.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) encompasses various pathological 
conditions causing spinal cord (SC) impairment, including spondylosis (multiple 
level degeneration), degenerative disc disease (DDD), ossification of the 
posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and ossification of the ligamentum 
flavum (OLF). It is considered the most common cause of SC dysfunction among the 
adult population. The degenerative phenomena of DDD, spondylosis, OPLL and OLF, 
is likely due to both inter-related and distinct factors. Age, cervical 
alignment, and range of motion, as well as congenital factors such as cervical 
cord-canal mismatch due to congenital stenosis, Klippel-Feil, Ehler-Danlos, and 
Down syndromes have been previously reported as potential factors of risk for 
DCM. The correlation between some comorbidities, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and movement disorders (Parkinson disease and cervical dystonia) and DCM, has 
also been reported; however, the literature remains scare. Other 
patient-specific factors including smoking, participation in contact sports, 
regular heavy load carrying on the head, and occupation (e.g. astronauts) have 
also been suggested as potential risk of myelopathy development. Most of the 
identified DCM risk factors remain poorly studied however. Further researches 
will be necessary to strengthen the current knowledge on the subject, especially 
concerning physical labors in order to identify patients at risk and to develop 
an effective treatment strategy for preventing this increasing prevalent 
disorder.

New-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), nilotinib and ponatinib, for 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have been reported to cause symptomatic 
cerebral ischemia. Herein, we report two patients with asymptomatic cerebral 
artery stenosis associated with these TKIs, as a previously unreported finding. 
Both patients were in their 40 s and administered new-generation TKIs without 
vascular risk factors. New-generation TKIs for CML can cause major 
cerebrovascular stenosis without any symptoms. Examining the neck and 
intracranial arteries using magnetic resonance angiography and carotid 
ultrasonography may prevent future cerebral infarctions associated with these 
TKIs.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the difference between tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy 
and identify the risk factors associated with the need for tracheostomy after 
traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (TCSCI).
METHODS: The demographic and injury characteristics of 456 TCSCI patients, 
treated in the Xinqiao Hospital from 2010 to 2019, were retrospective analyzed. 
Patients were divided into the tracheostomy group (n = 63) and the 
non-tracheostomy group (n = 393). Variables included were age, gender,smoking 
history, mechanism of injury, concomitant injury, American Spinal Injury 
Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, the neurological level of injury, Cervical 
Spine Injury Severity Score (CSISS), surgery, and length of stay in ICU and 
hospital. SPSS 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis and 
ROC curve drawing. Chi-square analysis was applied to find out the difference of 
variables between the tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy groups. Univariate 
logistic regression analysis (ULRA) and multiple logistic regression analysis 
(MLRA) were used to identify risk factors for tracheostomy. The area under the 
ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of these risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 456 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 63 (13.8%) underwent 
tracheostomy. There were differences in age (χ2 = 6.615, P = 0.032), mechanism 
of injury (χ2 = 9.87, P = 0.036), concomitant injury (χ2 = 6.131, P 
= 0.013),ASIA Impairment Scale (χ2 = 123.08, P < 0.01), the neurological level 
of injury (χ2 = 34.74, P < 0.01), and CSISS (χ2 = 19.612, P < 0.01) between the 
tracheostomy and non-tracheostomy groups. Smoking history, CSISS ≥ 7, AIS A and, 
NLI ≥ C5 were identified as potential risk factors for tracheostomy by ULRA. 
Smoking history (OR = 2.960, 95% CI: 1.524-5.750, P = 0.001), CSISS ≥ 7 
(OR = 4.599, 95% CI: 2.328-9.085, P = 0.000), AIS A (OR = 14.213, 95% CI: 
6.720-30.060, P = 0.000) and NLI ≥ C5 (OR = 8.312, 95% CI: 1.935-35.711, P 
= 0.004) as risk factors for tracheostomy were determined by MLRA. The AUC for 
the risk factors of tracheostomy after TCSCI was 0.858 (95% CI: 0.810-0.907).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking history, CSISS ≥ 7, AIS A and, NLI ≥ C5 were identified as 
risk factors needing of tracheostomy in patients with TCSCI. These risk factors 
may be important to assist the clinical decision of tracheostomy.

BACKGROUND: Early routine intubation in motor-complete cervical spinal cord 
injury (CSCI) above the C5 level is a conventional protocol to prevent 
unexpected respiratory exacerbation (RE). However, in the context of recent 
advances in multidisciplinary respiratory management, the absolute indication 
for intubation in patients with CSCI based on initial neurologic assessment is 
controversial because of the drawbacks of intubation. This study aimed to 
redetermine the most important predictor of RE following CSCI after admission 
without routine intubation among patients admitted with motor-complete injury 
and/or injury above the C5 level to ensure timely intubation.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with acute traumatic 
CSCI admitted to our hospital without an initial routine intubation protocol 
from January 2013 to December 2017. CSCI patients who developed RE (defined as 
unexpected emergent intubation for respiratory resuscitation) were compared with 
those who did not. Baseline characteristics and severity of trauma data were 
collected. Univariate analyses were performed to compare treatment data and 
clinical outcomes between the two groups. Further, multivariate logistic 
regression was performed with clinically important independent variables: 
motor-complete injury, neurologic level above C5, atelectasis, and copious 
airway secretion (CAS).
RESULTS: Among 58 patients with CSCI, 35 (60.3%) required post-injury intubation 
and 1 (1.7%) died during hospitalization. Thirteen (22.4%) had RE 3.5 days 
(mean) post-injury; 3 (37.5%) of eight patients with motor-complete CSCI above 
C5 developed RE. Eleven of the 27 (40.7%) patients with motor-complete injury 
and five of the 22 (22.7%) patients with neurologic injury above C5 required 
emergency intubation at RE. Three of the eight CSCI patients with both risk 
factors (motor-complete injury above C5) resulted in emergent RE intubation 
(37.5%). CAS was an independent predictor for RE (odds ratio 7.19, 95% 
confidence interval 1.48-42.72, P = 0.0144) in multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: Timely intubation post-CSCI based on close attention to CAS during 
the acute 3-day phase may prevent RE and reduce unnecessary invasive airway 
control even without immediate routine intubation in motor-complete injury above 
C5.

OBJECTIVE: Anterior cervical corpectomy using a titanium mesh cage may result in 
delayed nonunion and thus a change in cervical alignment, and patients may 
require revision surgery. We investigated the radiologic and clinical outcomes 
of cervical corpectomy and the risk factors for subsidence.
METHODS: We studied 74 patients who underwent single-level anterior cervical 
corpectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy with or without ossification of 
the posterior longitudinal ligament between 2007 and 2014. Graft subsidence was 
considered present when there was a reduction in the anterior and posterior 
heights by an average of 4 mm or more 2 years after the operation. We measured 
cervical parameters before surgery, immediately after surgery, and 6, 12, and 24 
months after surgery. The clinical outcomes were the neck and arm visual analog 
scale scores and reoperation rate.
RESULTS: In the subsidence group, these values gradually decreased over the 24 
months. The radiologic parameters did not differ between the 2 groups for 24 
months after the onset of subsidence. There were no differences in clinical 
outcome or reoperation rate. In the analysis of the risk factors, subsidence 
occurred with a large T1 slope and a large change in the C27 Cobb angle (p=0.020 
and p=0.026, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Subsidence gradually occurred after single-level anterior cervical 
corpectomy for up to 24 months. However, the presence of subsidence did not 
affect the radiologic and clinical outcomes. When the T1 slope was large and the 
C27 Cobb angle change was severe, more subsidence occurred.

INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are increasingly being used to 
treat numerous cancer types. Together with improved recognition of toxicities, 
this has led to more frequent identification of rare immune-related adverse 
events (irAE), for which specific treatment strategies are needed. Neutropenia 
is a rare hematological irAE that has a potential for a high mortality rate 
because of its associated risk of sepsis. Prompt recognition and timely 
treatment of this life-threatening irAE are therefore critical to the outcome of 
patients with immune-related neutropenia.
METHODS: This multicenter international retrospective study was conducted at 17 
melanoma centers to evaluate the clinical characteristics, diagnostics, 
treatment, and outcomes of melanoma patients with grade 4 neutropenia (<500 
neutrophils/µl blood) treated with ICI between 2014 and 2020. Some of these 
patients received metamizole in addition to ICI (ICI+/met+). Bone marrow 
biopsies (BMB) of these patients were compared to BMB from non-ICI treated 
patients with metamizole-induced grade 4 neutropenia (ICI-/met+).
RESULTS: In total, 10 patients (median age at neutropenia onset: 66 years; seven 
men) with neutropenia were identified, equating to an incidence of 0.14%. Median 
onset of neutropenia was 6.4 weeks after starting ICI (range 1.4-49.1 weeks). 
Six patients showed inflammatory symptoms, including fever (n=3), erysipelas 
(n=1), pharyngeal abscess (n=1), and mucositis (n=1). Neutropenia was diagnosed 
in all patients by a differential blood count and additionally performed 
procedures including BMB (n=5). Nine of 10 patients received granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) to treat their grade 4 neutropenia. Four 
patients received systemic steroids (including two in combination with G-CSF, 
and one in combination with G-CSF and additional ciclosporin A). Four patients 
were treated with one or more antibiotic treatment lines, two with antimycotic 
treatment, and one with additional antiviral therapy. Five patients received 
metamizole concomitantly with ICI. One fatal outcome was reported. BMB indicated 
a numerically lower CD4+ to CD8+ T cells ratio in patients with irNeutropenia 
than in those with metamizole-induced neutropenia.
CONCLUSION: Grade 4 neutropenia is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect of ICI treatment. Most cases were sufficiently managed using G-CSF; 
however, adequate empiric antibiotic, antiviral, and antimycotic treatments 
should be administered if neutropenic infections are suspected. 
Immunosuppression using corticosteroids may be considered after other causes of 
neutropenia have been excluded.

Fanconi anemia is a rare disorder resulting from defects in genes responsible 
for DNA damage responses. It is characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic 
anemia, and a predisposition to cancer. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment available for bone marrow 
failure; however, HSCT increases oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk. Here 
we report the case of a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia in childhood who 
was treated with HSCT and later diagnosed with multiple OSCCs during a 12-year 
follow-up. Despite multiple surgical interventions and radiotherapy regimens, 
the patient`s health deteriorated. Management of individuals with Fanconi anemia 
is challenging and must be provided by a multidisciplinary healthcare team to 
ensure better staging, treatment planning, and coordination.

Immune-mediated myelopathy (IMM) diagnosis is challenging, and its etiology may 
remain unclear despite extensive investigation. We evaluated diagnostic changes 
in IMM patients during follow-up. We included 80 patients, 61.3% female, with 
median follow-up time 62.5 months. Diagnoses at discharge were: 48.8% Multiple 
Sclerosis-IMM (MS-IMM), 32.5% I-IMM, 11.3% Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum 
Disorders-IMM (NMOSD-IMM), 1.3% MOG encephalomyelitis (MOGAD), and 6.2% Others 
IMM (O-IMM). Twenty-two  patients (27.5%) changed diagnosis (median 
15.5  months): 68.8% MS-IMM, 12.5%  NMOSD-IMM, 3.8% MOGAD, 10.0% I-IMM, and 5.0% 
O-IMM. Most patients that changed diagnosis were I-IMM. Predictive factors for 
diagnostic change in I-IMM were: autonomous gait (p = 0.029), lesions suggestive 
of MS (p = 0.039), higher number of lesions (p = 0.043), lesions length < 3 
vertebral bodies (p = 0.033), cervical involvement (p = 0.038), and lower EDSS 
at admission (p = 0.013). Etiologic reclassifications in IMM are common, 
therefore patients require an appropriate follow-up time to increase diagnostic 
accuracy.

Pseudarthrosis of the cervical spine represents a common and challenging problem 
for spine surgeons. Rates vary greatly from as low as 0%-20% to >60% and depend 
heavily on patient factors, approach, and number of levels. While some patients 
remain asymptomatic from pseudarthrosis, many require revision surgery due to 
instability, continued neck pain, or radiculopathy/myelopathy. We aimed to 
provide a practical, narrative review of cervical pseudarthrosis to address the 
following areas: (1) definitions, (2) incidence, (3) risk factors, (4) 
presentation and workup, (5) treatment decision-making, and (6) postoperative 
care. It is our hope the current review provides a concise summary for how to 
diagnose and treat challenging cervical nonunions.

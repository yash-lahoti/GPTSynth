BACKGROUND: In patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, 10-20% has concomitant 
thoracic aortic pathologies. These are typically managed with staged 
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair 
(TEVAR) due to a perceived higher risk of spinal cord ischemia from a 
simultaneous intervention. We aimed to determine the outcomes of patients 
undergoing simultaneous EVAR and TEVAR for concomitant aneurysms.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Vascular Quality 
Initiative registry from December 2003 to January 2021. Patients undergoing same 
day EVAR and TEVAR were included and analyzed in accordance with the Society for 
Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Primary outcomes were technical success 
and spinal cord ischemia.
RESULTS: Simultaneous EVAR and TEVAR were performed in 25 patients. Median age 
was 75.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 63.0-79.0) years and 20 (80.0%) patients 
were male. Two (4.0%) patients were symptomatic and 4 (16.0%) presented with 
rupture. Median maximum infrarenal and thoracic aortic diameter was 57.0 (IQR, 
52.0-65.0). Infrarenal aortic neck length was 15.0 mm (IQR, 10.0-25.0), and 
diameter was 27.0 mm (IQR, 24.5-30.0). Median procedure time was 185.0 min (IQR, 
117.8-251.3), fluoroscopy time 32.7 min (IQR, 21.8-63.1), and contrast volume 
165 mL (IQR, 115.0-207.0). There were 3 (12.0%) Type Ia endoleaks and 3 (12.0%) 
Type II endoleaks in EVAR's, with 1 (4.0%) Type Ia and 1 (4.0%) Type II endoleak 
in TEVARs. In-hospital mortality occurred in 3 (12.0%) patients (1 elective, 2 
ruptures). Spinal cord ischemia occurred in 1 (4.0%) patient. This patient had a 
symptomatic aneurysm. Thoracic coverage extended from Zone 4 to Zone 5 and an 
emergent spinal drain was placed postoperatively. Symptoms were present on 
discharge. There was 1 (4.0%) conversion to open repair which occurred in a 
ruptured aneurysm. Technical success was achieved in 19 (76.0%) patients, 
however when excluding ruptured aneurysms, was achieved in 17 (81.0%) patients. 
Follow-up data was available for 19 (76.0%) patients at a median of 426.0 (IQR, 
329.0-592.5) days postoperatively. A total of 3 (12.0%) patients died during the 
late mortality period, at a mean of 509.0 (±503.7) days. Median change in 
abdominal and thoracic aortic sac diameter was -1.35 mm (IQR, -11.5 to 2.5) and 
8.0 (IQR, -10.5 to 12.0), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous EVAR and TEVAR for concomitant abdominal and thoracic 
aortic aneurysms can be performed with low rates of spinal cord ischemia. Short- 
and mid-term outcomes are acceptable.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify independent factors associated with 
cervical spinal injuries in head-injured patients. The extent of injuries to 
other body parts was assessed by the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and was 
included in the analysis.
METHODS: Consecutive head-injured patients admitted via the emergency department 
from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The 
inclusion criteria were head-injured patients with an Abbreviated Injury Scale 
(AIS) score ≥2 (i.e., head injuries with intracranial hematoma or skull 
fracture). Patients with minor head injuries with only scalp abrasions or 
superficial lacerations without significant intracranial injuries (i.e., head 
injury AIS score = 1) were excluded. The primary outcome was to identify 
independent predictors associated with cervical spinal injuries in these 
head-injured patients. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 1105 patients were identified. Of these patients, 11.2% (n = 
124) had cervical spinal injuries. Univariate and multivariable analyses 
identified male gender (P = 0.006), the presence of thoracic injury (including 
rib fracture, hemothorax, or pneumothorax) (P = 0.010), and hypotension with 
systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg on admission (P = 0.009) as independent 
predictors for cervical spinal injury in head-injured patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that about 1 in 10 patients with significant head 
injury had cervical spine injury, usually associated with fracture or 
dislocation. Male gender, the presence of thoracic injury, and hypotension on 
admission were independent risk factors associated with cervical spinal 
injuries.

Rugby players are subject to multiple impacts to their head and neck that could 
have adverse neurological effects and put them at increased risk of 
neurodegeneration. Previous studies demonstrated altered default mode network 
and diffusion metrics on brain, as well as more foraminal stenosis, disc 
protrusion and neck pain among players of contact sports as compared to healthy 
controls. However, the long-term effects of practice and repetitive impacts on 
brain and cervical spinal cord (cSC) of the rugby players have never been 
systematically investigated. In this study, 15 retired professional and amateur 
rugby players (R) and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (all males; mean age 
R: 46.8 ± 7.6; and HC: 48.6 ± 9.5) were recruited both to investigate cord 
impairments and further characterize brain structure damage. Medical 
questionnaires including modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (mJOA) 
and Neck Disability Index (NDI) were filled by all participants. A 3 T 
multi-parametric MR protocol including conventional qualitative techniques such 
as T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences, as well as state-of-the art 
quantitative techniques including MP2RAGE T1 mapping and 3D ihMTRAGE, was used 
on both brain and cSC. Normalized brain WM and GM volumes, spine Overall 
Stenosis Score, cord cross-sectional area and regional T1 and ihMT metrics were 
derived from these acquisitions. Rugby players showed significantly higher NDI 
scores, as well as a faster decline of normalized brain GM volume with age as 
compared to HC. Moreover, higher T1 values on cSC suggestive of structural 
degeneration, together with higher T1 and lower ihMTsat on brain WM suggestive 
of demyelination, were observed in retired rugby players as compared to 
age-matched controls, which may suggest cumulative effects of long-term impacts 
on the tissues. Metrics also suggest early aging and different aging processes 
on brain tissue in the players. These preliminary observations provide new 
insights in the domain, which should now be further investigated on larger 
cohorts and multicentric longitudinal studies, and further correlated to the 
likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases and risk factors.

Residual anterior cord compression after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy: evaluation of risk factors according to the most severely stenotic 
vertebral segment.

Shimizu T, Fujibayashi S, Otsuki B, Murata K, Masuda S, Matsuda S.

OBJECTIVE: Residual anterior spinal cord compression (RASCC) after cervical 
laminoplasty, which has been confirmed on postoperative MRI, is reportedly 
associated with poor clinical outcomes. To date, only a few studies have 
described the risk factors associated with RASCC. The aim of this study was to 
identify the factors that can predict the occurrence of RASCC after laminoplasty 
for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), focusing on the location of the most 
stenotic segment.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, 120 patients who underwent 
C3-7 laminoplasty for multilevel CSM were included. Different techniques were 
used for C3 decompression, i.e., partial (dome-laminotomy) or complete 
(laminoplasty/laminectomy) decompression. RASCC was diagnosed using MRI 
conducted 3 weeks postoperatively. The patients were divided into two groups 
according to the segment with the most severe stenosis (Seg-MSS; C3-4 vs C4-7). 
Demographics, radiological data, and C3 decompression technique were compared 
between the two groups. Furthermore, intergroup comparisons were performed based 
on Seg-MSS. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify the factors 
predicting RASCC after patient stratification according to Seg-MSS.
RESULTS: Forty patients (33.3%) had RASCC. The patients with Seg-MSS at C3-4 
(51.3%) had a significantly higher incidence of RASCC (p = 0.003) than those 
with Seg-MSS at C4-7 (24.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed that in 
patients with Seg-MSS at C3-4, C3 partial decompression demonstrated a greater 
association with RASCC as opposed to complete decompression. Conversely, in 
patients with Seg-MSS at C4-7, kyphotic segmental lordotic angle was associated 
with an increased risk of RASCC.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for RASCC differed depending on the location of 
the most stenotic segment (C3-4 vs C4-7). If there is segmental kyphosis at the 
most stenotic segment at C4-7, anterior decompression and fusion should be 
considered. If C3-4 is the most stenotic segment, anterior surgery is also 
recommended, but alternatively, one can choose laminoplasty with complete C3 
laminectomy and resection of the C2-3 ligamentum flavum.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: High cord signals (HCS) are common in patients undergoing 
surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Few studies have 
investigated the prognostic effects of postoperative HCS changes.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether different changes in the postoperative magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted images (T2WIs) signal intensity ratio (SIR) 
is related to patient outcomes, predictors of unsatisfactory recovery, and the 
factors associated with changes in postoperative SIR.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review at a single institution.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The study population included all consecutive patients who 
showed HCS in preoperative MRI T2WIs and underwent double-door laminoplasty for 
DCM from December 2017 to December 2020.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient self-reported measures included the Japanese 
Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) physical 
component score, and SF-36 mental component score. Imaging measures included 
SIR, length of HCS, and canal narrowing ratio (CNR).
METHODS: We reviewed patient records and analyzed the statistical associations 
of MRI T2WI measures with the JOA score, SF-36 physical, and mental component 
scores.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were categorized into three groups based on the 
postoperative HCS changes, identified from MRI T2WI before and after surgery: 
reduced (Group A, N=26); unchanged (Group B, N=12); and increased (Group C, 
N=15). The neurological recovery rates 12 months after surgery were 
67.72%±17.45% in Group A, 51.53%±16.00% in Group B, and 13.35%±21.35% in Group C 
(p<.001). Significant differences across the three groups were found in symptom 
duration, postoperative SIR and length of HCS, pre- and postoperative CNR, 
recovery rate, JOA, SF-36 scores, with patients in Group C having the worst 
outcomes. Longer DCM symptom duration, greater preoperative CNR, and increased 
postoperative HCS were prognostic factors for a recovery rate<50%. Preoperative 
CNR, with an optimal threshold of 57.303%, was an independent risk factor for 
increased postoperative HCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Less than one-third of DCM patients with preoperative HCS exhibited 
an increase in HCS after double-door laminoplasty and reported worse outcomes at 
the 12-month follow-up when compared to patients with decreased or unchanged 
postoperative HCS.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and factors 
associated with the development of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) 
after cervical cancer (CC).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort of 3551 women with CC who underwent treatment 
at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were included in the study. Clinical 
and sociodemographic variables were obtained from the Hospital Cancer Registry 
and from hospital records. A descriptive study of the population was carried 
out, using means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages. The 
Kaplan-Meier curve was used to identify annual incidence rates. Associations 
between the independent variables and the outcome (MSCC) were evaluated by a 
univariate analysis, applying crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) assuming 95% 
confidence intervals.
RESULTS: The MSCC incidence was of 1.5% (n = 51), associated to advanced staging 
(aOR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.45-4.85, p = 0.001) and initial treatment with 
concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (aOR = 4.40, 95% CI: 1.74-11.13, 
p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the incidence and factors associated with 
MSCC, indicating a subset of patients who may be potential targets for the 
prevention and early treatment of this condition, indicating unprecedented and 
relevant data for the Brazilian epidemiological scenario due to the high CC 
incidence rates.

BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a well-documented complication of 
cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA), although it rarely causes adverse clinical 
effects. Despite high-grade HO possibly limiting segmental mobility, it is 
reportedly seldom associated with symptoms.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors report a case of a 46-year-old male patient who 
underwent hybrid CDA and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for 3-level 
cervical disc herniation that caused myeloradiculopathy. The surgery was 
successful; the patient experienced nearly complete recovery postoperatively. 
The follow-up images, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
imaging scans, showed satisfactory decompression at the indexed levels without 
residual osteophytes or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. 
However, 10 years later, the patient presented with symptomatic compressive 
myelopathy caused by severe HO that prompted a secondary surgery.
LESSONS: Although it is generally reported in the literature that HO is 
clinically innocuous, in this patient, it gradually and progressively developed 
and caused myelopathy, requiring a secondary surgery. Symptomatic HO can be 
expected over time, and patients with a high risk of HO deserve long-term 
follow-up after CDA. Further investigations are warranted to corroborate these 
risk factors, including multilevel calcified disc herniation, severe 
spondylosis, and suboptimal placement of the device during primary CDA surgery.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative 
disease that can lead to significant functional disability. Improving treatment 
regimens have extended life expectancy and led to an increase in the number of 
elective spine surgeries for degenerative conditions in the MS population. 
Recent literature has reported mixed results regarding the efficacy of elective 
spine surgery for patients with MS. There is also a paucity of literature 
comparing postoperative patient reported outcomes (PROs) and reoperation rates 
between patients with and without MS.
PURPOSE: To determine if patients with MS have worse PROs and higher 
complication, readmission and reoperation rates after elective spine surgery 
compared with patients without neurodegenerative conditions when adjusting for 
baseline covariates through propensity matching.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 
the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD), a national, longitudinal, multicenter spine 
outcomes registry.
PATIENT SAMPLE: For the lumbar cohort, 312 patients with MS and 46,738 patients 
without MS were included. The cervical myelopathy cohort included 91 patients 
with MS and 6,426 patients without MS. The cervical radiculopathy cohort 
consisted of 103 patients with MS and 13,751 patients without MS.
OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) complication rates, 2) readmission rates, 3) reoperation 
rates, and 4) PROs at 3- and 12-months including ODI/NDI, NRS back/neck/arm/leg 
pain, mJOA scores and patient satisfaction ratings.
METHODS: Data from the QOD was queried for patients with surgeries occurring 
between 04/2013-01/2019. Three surgical groups were included: 1) Elective lumbar 
surgery, 2) Elective cervical surgery for myelopathy, 3) Elective cervical 
surgery for radiculopathy. Patients with any neurodegenerative condition other 
than MS were excluded. Patients without MS were propensity matched against 
patients with MS in a 5 to 1 ratio without replacement based on ASA grade, 
arthrodesis, surgical approach, number of operated levels, age, and baseline 
ODI/NDI, NRS leg/arm pain, NRS back/neck pain, and EQ-5D. Multivariable 
regressions with cluster-robust standard errors were used to estimate average 
effect of how the outcome would change if the MS patient didn't have the 
disease. The mean difference was used for continuous outcomes and the risk 
difference was used for binary outcomes.
RESULTS: For the lumbar cohort, no differences were found between the 2 groups 
at 3 or 12 months in any of the outcome measures. For the myelopathy cohort, 
patients with MS patients had a lower rate of reoperation at 12 months (risk 
difference=-0.036, p=.007) and worse 3-month mJOA scores (mean 
difference=-1.044, p=.004) compared with patients without MS. For the 
radiculopathy cohort, patients with MS had a lower rate of reoperation at 3 
months (risk difference=-0.019, p=.018) and 12 months (risk difference=-0.029, 
p=.007) compared with those without MS.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS had similar PROs compared with patients without MS 
when adjusting for baseline covariates through propensity matching, except for 
3-month mJOA scores in the myelopathy cohort. Reoperation rates were found to be 
lower in patients with MS undergoing elective cervical surgery for both 
myelopathy and radiculopathy. These results suggest that when analyzed 
independently, a diagnosis of MS does not significantly impact complication, 
readmission and reoperation rates or PROs, and therefore should not represent a 
major contraindication to elective spine surgery. Surgical decisions in this 
patient population should be made based on careful consideration of patient 
factors including other comorbidities as well as baseline patient functional 
status.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and to clarify the risk factors of DVT in patients with acute 
spinal cord injury (SCI) complicated with cervical fractures at admission. From 
January 2018 to December 2021, a total of 175 patients with acute SCI 
complicated with cervical fractures in our hospital were retrospectively 
analyzed. Duplex ultrasound was used to diagnose the DVT. All patients' medical 
record data, including demographic variables, medical history, and laboratory 
results, were collected. The patients were divided into DVT group and non-DVT 
group according to ultrasound results. The prevalence of DVT was determined and 
risk factors of DVT were identified. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of different factors. 
The prevalence of DVT at admission was 21.71%(38/175), including one (2.63%) 
with central DVT, thirty-two (84.21%) with peripheral DVT and five (13.16%) with 
mixed DVT. The multivariate analysis revealed that decreased lower extremity 
muscle strength, time from injury to admission, and D-dimer were risk factors 
for DVT at admission. The diagnostic value of D-dimer was the highest among 
these risk factors. In conclusion, in patients with acute SCI complicated with 
cervical fractures, the risk of DVT at admission is very high. Decreased lower 
extremity muscle strength, time from injury to admission, and D-dimer are risk 
factors for DVT. Moreover, D-dimer has the highest diagnostic value among these 
risk factors.

Xi'an, China.

PURPOSE: To analyze the relative factors influencing in-hospital mortality in 
patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), and develop a score scale for 
predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality.
METHOD: We reviewed the medical records from 59 spine centers in mainland China 
from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. The inclusion criteria were (1) 
confirmed diagnosis of TSCI, (2) hospitalization within 7 days of injury, and 
(3) affecting neurological level from C1 to L1. The exclusion criteria were (1) 
readmission, and (2) incomplete data. Included patients were classified into the 
survival and non-survival groups according to their status at discharge. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify the 
factors related to in-hospital mortality in patients with TSCI. A new scale was 
developed, and the mortality rate in each risk group was calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 3,176 participants, 23 (0.7%) died in the hospital, and most of 
them died from respiratory diseases (17/23, 73.9%). After univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, cervical spinal cord injury [odds 
ratio (OR) = 0.264, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.076-0.917, P = 0.036], 
abdominal visceral injury (OR = 3.778, 95% CI: 1.038-13.755, P = 0.044), the 
American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score on admission (A: reference; B:OR 
= 0.326, 95% CI: 0.093-1.146, P = 0.081; C:OR = 0.070, 95% CI: 0.016-0.308, P < 
0.001; D:OR = 0.069, 95% CI: 0.019-0.246, P < 0.001), and surgery (OR = 0.341, 
95% CI: 0.146-0.796, P = 0.013) were significantly associated with in-hospital 
mortality. Scores for each of the four factors were derived according to 
mortality rates. The sum of the scores from all four factors was included in the 
scoring system and represented the risk of in-hospital mortality. The 
in-hospital mortality risk of the low-risk (0-3 points), moderate-risk (4-5 
points), and high-risk groups (6-8 points) was 0.3, 2.7, and 9.7%, respectively 
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spinal cord injury, abdominal visceral injury, ASIA score 
on admission, and surgery were significantly associated with in-hospital 
mortality in patients with TSCI and stable condition. The scale system may be 
beneficial for clinical decision-making and for communicating relevant 
information to patients and their families.

Predictive Nomogram for Clinical Prognosis in Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy 
With Intramedullary T2-Weighted Increased Signal Intensity: A Novel Digital Tool 
for Patient Prognosis Education.

Wang J(1), Li H(1), Yang B(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an 
Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.

AIMS: To establish a predictive nomogram for clinical prognosis in cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) with intramedullary T2-weighted increased signal 
intensity (ISI).
METHODS: The clinical data of 680 patients with CSM with intramedullary 
T2-weighted ISI were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 
the modeling group (476) and the validation group (204) by using a random number 
table at a ratio of 7:3. The independent prognostic factors were screened using 
multivariate logistic regression analysis. The factors were subsequently 
incorporated into the establishment of the predictive nomogram. The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was undertaken to 
estimate the discrimination of the predictive nomogram. The calibration curve 
and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess the calibration of the 
predictive nomogram. The clinical usefulness of the predictive nomogram was 
evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Based on the pre-operative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, 
maximal canal compromise (MCC), and maximal spinal cord compression (MSCC), we 
established a predictive nomogram. The AUCs in the modeling group and validation 
group were 0.892 (95% CI: 0.861~0.924) and 0.885 (95% CI: 0.835~0.936), 
respectively, suggesting good discrimination of the nomogram. Calibration curves 
showed a favorable consistency between the predicted probability and the actual 
probability. In addition, the values of P of the Hosmer-Lemeshow were 0.253 and 
0.184, respectively, suggesting good calibration of the nomogram. DCA 
demonstrated that the nomogram had good clinical usefulness.
CONCLUSION: We established and validated a predictive nomogram for the clinical 
prognosis in CSM with intramedullary T2-weighted ISI. This predictive nomogram 
could help clinicians and patients identify high-risk patients and educate them 
about prognosis, thereby improving the prognosis of high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to explore the sagittal radiological 
parameters related to the occurrence of C5 nerve palsy after cervical posterior 
open-door laminoplasty for the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients who underwent cervical posterior open-door 
laminoplasty were reviewed retrospectively from March 2017 to March 2022. The 
C2-7 Cobb angle, C2-7 sagittal vertex axis, thoracic inlet angle, neck tilt, T1 
slope, and encroachment ratio of ossification were measured on X-rays. The 
enrolled patients were divided into C5 nerve palsy and control groups. Logistic 
regression was performed to analyze the potential risk factors for the 
occurrence of C5 nerve palsy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the significance of 
the results and the optimal diagnostic value.
RESULTS: The results of logistic regression showed that only the T1 slope and 
encroachment ratio were variables that were responsible for C5 nerve palsy (P = 
0.024; P = 0.04). The ROC curve analysis for the T1 slope showed that the cutoff 
value was 21.3° and the AUC was 0.796. The ROC curve analysis for the 
encroachment ratio revealed that the cutoff value was 0.21 and the AUC was 
0.763. Both analyses demonstrated good diagnostic value for C5 nerve palsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative T1 slope and encroachment ratio were variables 
that were risk factors for C5 nerve palsy in patients who underwent cervical 
posterior open-door laminoplasty.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study conducted at a single academic institution.
PURPOSE: This study compared the postoperative alignment of consecutive double 
laminectomies according to their decompression levels and investigated the 
influence of the extension unit of the spinous process and its attached muscles 
on postoperative alignment.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Many reports have investigated bony and soft tissue 
factors as the causes of postoperative cervical alignment disorders. 
To-this-date, no other article has clarified the importance of the attached 
muscles between the spinous processes of C3 and C6 to maintain local cervical 
alignment.
METHODS: In total, 155 consecutive patients who underwent muscle-preserving 
consecutive double laminectomies for cervical spondylotic myelopathy from 2005 
to 2013 were included in this study. The imaging parameters included the C2-C7 
angle, range of motion, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), C7 slope, C2-C5 
angle, C5-C7 angle, local disk angle caudal to the decompression level, and the 
disk height between C2/C3 and C7/Th1.
RESULTS: The caudal disk angle of the decompression level decreased after 
consecutive double laminectomies, thus suggesting that the extension unit 
maintained the local lordosis at the lower disk of the decompression level. 
Postoperatively, in the C3-4 decompression cases, the C2-C7 angle decreased by 
7.3°, and the C2-C7 SVA increased by 8.6 mm, thus indicating the appearance of 
an alignment disorder. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
cephalad laminectomy was a risk factor for C2-C7 angle decreases >10°. However, 
the postoperative recovery rate of Japanese Orthopedic Association scores after 
consecutive double laminectomies was reasonable, and the overall cervical 
alignment was well maintained in all decompression levels except C3-C4.
CONCLUSIONS: The cervical extension unit maintained lordosis at the disk caudal 
to it. The extension unit was found to contribute more to the maintenance of 
lordosis of the entire cervical spine at the cephalad side.

College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze various risk factors that can 
cause postoperative delirium (POD) in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) 
patients, which may affect normal recovery and outcomes after surgery, and to 
help deal with them in advance and to take a medical approach.
METHODS: A total of 148 patients aged 60 years or older who underwent 
laminoplasty or anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for DCM from 2008 
to 2015 were included in this study. Incidence and multiple risk factors for 
development of POD were analyzed.
RESULTS: POD occurred in 24 patients (16.2%). Among the 148 patients, 78 
received laminoplasty, of whom 19 patients (24%) experienced delirium; the other 
70 patients underwent ACDF, of whom 5 patients (7.1%) experienced delirium. 
History of Parkinson disease (odds ratio [OR], 178.242; p = 0.015), potassium 
level (OR, 3.764; p = 0.031), and surgical approach of laminoplasty over ACDF 
(OR, 8.538; p = 0.008) were found to be significant risk factors in a 
multivariate analysis. Age (OR, 1.056; p = 0.04) and potassium level (OR, 3.217; 
p = 0.04) were significant risk factors in the laminoplasty group.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the incidence and risk 
factors for POD may vary in patients with DCM. It is necessary to understand 
multiple factors that affect the development of POD.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to determine the rate of improvement 
of significant preoperative weakness, identify risk factors for failure to 
improve, and characterize the motor recovery of individual motor groups.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: While neck and arm pain reliably improve following 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), the frequency and magnitude of 
motor recovery following ACDF remain unclear.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing 1-4-level 
ACDF at a single institution between September 2015 and June 2016. Patients were 
subdivided into 2 groups based upon the presence or absence of significant 
preoperative weakness, which was defined as a motor grade <4 in any single upper 
extremity muscle group. Clinical notes were reviewed to determine affected 
muscle groups, rates of motor recovery, and risk factors for failure to improve.
RESULTS: We identified 618 patients for inclusion. Significant preoperative 
upper extremity weakness was present in 27 patients (4.4%). Postoperatively, 19 
of the affected patients (70.3%) experienced complete strength recovery, and 5 
patients (18.5%) experienced an improvement in muscle strength to a motor grade 
≥4. The rate of motor recovery postoperatively was 85.7% in the triceps, 83.3% 
in the finger flexors, 83.3% in the hand intrinsics, 50.0% in the biceps, and 
25.0% in the deltoids. Risk factors for failure to experience significant motor 
improvement were the presence of myelomalacia (odds ratio: 28.9, P <0.01) and 
the performance of >2 levels of ACDF (odds ratio: 10.1, P <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with substantial preoperative upper extremity weakness can 
expect high rates of motor recovery following ACDF, though patients with deltoid 
weakness, myelomalacia, and >2 levels of ACDF are less likely to experience 
significant motor improvement.

OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the risk factors in patients who developed distal 
junctional kyphosis (DJK) after posterior cervical fusion.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 
64 patients, aged ≥18 years (51 and 13 male and female patients, respectively), 
who underwent single-staged multilevel (3-6 levels) posterior cervical fusion 
surgery due to multiple cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The surgeries were 
performed by a single spinal surgeon between January 2012 and December 2017. 
Demographic data, clinical outcomes, and radiological results were collected. We 
divided the patients into a DJK group and a non-DJK group according to the 
presence of DJK and investigated the risk factors by comparing the differences 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 64 patients, 13 developed DJK. No significant differences in 
clinical results were observed between the two groups before and immediately 
after the surgery. At the final follow-up, a higher visual analog score for neck 
pain was observed in the DJK group compared to the non-DJK group (p<0.01). The 
DJK group had a significantly lower T1 slope and a significantly higher C2-7 
sagittal vertical axis (SVA) before surgery compared to the non-DJK group 
(p=0.03 and p<0.01, respectively). Immediately after surgery, the difference 
between the two groups decreased and no significant difference was observed. 
However, at the last followup, a significantly higher C2-7 SVA was observed in 
the DJK group (p<0.01). At the last follow up, there is no discrepancy in 
T1S-CL. In multiple logistic regression analysis, preoperative higher C2-7 SVA 
and preoperative lower T1 slope were identified as independent risk factors 
(p=0.03 and p<0.01, respectively). As a result, it was confirmed that DJK 
occurred along the process of returning to preoperative values.
CONCLUSION: DJK can be considered to be caused by cervical misalignment due to 
excessive change in the surgical site in patients with low T1 slope and high 
C2-7 SVA before surgery. This also affects the clinical outcome after surgery. 
It is recommended to refrain from excessive segmental lordosis changes during 
multilevel cervical post fusion surgery, especially in patients with a small 
preoperative T1 slope and a large SVA value.

A 73-year-old woman was hospitalized with sudden chest pain and hematemesis. 
Chest computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an 
idiopathic submucosal hematoma from the cervical esophagus to the 
esophagogastric mucosal junction. Idiopathic esophageal submucosal hematoma is 
often prone to a bleeding tendency of an underlying disorder. The patient had a 
history of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and was taking aspirin. She 
successfully recovered after aspirin discontinuation and conservative treatment; 
however, died of cardiopulmonary arrest in the ward on day 9 of hospitalization. 
The autopsy revealed that the cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism. This 
is the first report of ET with submucosal hematoma of the esophagus. The 
possibility of an esophageal submucosal hematoma should be considered when 
patients with ET complain of chest pain since ET and treatment with aspirin are 
considered risk factors for bleeding. Additionally, close attention should be 
focused on the risk of developing thrombosis if a patient with 
myeloproliferative neoplasm is required to discontinue antithrombotic therapy 
due to a bleeding event.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of cervical spine deformity and 
instability after posterior cervical spinal cord tumor (CSCT) resection without 
fusion or fixation in adults and examine relevant risk factors by reviewing and 
summarizing previously reported studies.
METHODS: We selected peer reviewed articles published between January 1990 and 
December 2020 from the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases using relevant key 
words. Articles in which the authors mainly described spinal cord tumor 
resection through posterior surgery without fusion or fixation in adults were 
selected for analysis. Patient's data including age, sex, extensive number of 
laminectomy levels, laminectomy at C2, C3, or C7, multilevel facetectomy, facet 
destruction, preoperative cervical kyphosis, and preoperative motor deficit were 
documented. Comparable factors were assessed using the odds ratio (OR) and 
weighted mean difference (WMD) of 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: Among 133 articles identified, 18 met selection criteria. Overall 
incidence of deformity and instability after CSCT surgery was 0%-41.7% and 
0%-20.5%, respectively. Younger age (WMD, -5.5; 95% CI, -10.52 ∼ -0.49; 
P = 0.03), C2 laminectomy (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 2.39 ∼ 11.91; P < 0.0001), more 
laminectomy level (WMD, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.78 ∼ 3.76; P < 0.00001) were identified 
as risk factors for deformity and instability after CSCT surgery.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing CSCT resection should receive careful follow-up 
for postoperative spinal deformity and instability. Younger age, C2 laminectomy, 
and more laminectomy level were significantly associated with occurrence of 
deformity and instability after CSCT surgery. Upfront spinal fixation at the 
time of resection should be considered in selected patients.

OBJECTIVE: Dysphagia following anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS) is common. 
This study aimed to determine if change in intervertebral distraction following 
ACSS is associated with early dysphagia.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined patients who underwent ACSS for myelopathy 
and/or radiculopathy in our institution. The Bazaz score and the Chinese version 
of the Swallowing-Quality of Life survey were used to assess postoperative 
swallowing function. Change in intervertebral distraction was defined as the 
difference between the preoperative and postoperative mean values of the 
anterior and posterior intervertebral distances at the surgical site. Potential 
risk factors examined included age, gender, body mass index, operative time, 
blood loss volume, level of surgery, as well as radiographic data including Cobb 
angle, T1 slope, sagittal vertical axis, and intervertebral distraction.
RESULTS: Among the 289 patients, the incidence of dysphagia was 58.1% 1 week 
after ACSS. Patients who underwent surgery involving C3/4 or involving three or 
more levels had worse Swallowing-Quality of Life and Bazaz scores. The optimal 
cutoff value for change in intervertebral distraction for predicting dysphagia 
1 week after surgery was 6.10 mm. Change in intervertebral 
distraction ≥ 6.10 mm, surgery involving C3/4, and surgery involving three or 
more levels were significantly and independently associated with early 
dysphagia.
CONCLUSION: A correlation between early dysphagia and change in intervertebral 
distraction ≥ 6.10 mm could be confirmed. In addition, patients undergoing ACSS 
involving C3-4 or multilevel surgery (≥3) must be monitored carefully 
postoperatively for dysfunctional swallowing.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Cervical laminoplasty (CLP) is an effective spinal cord 
decompression method for patients with cervical myelopathy. However, cervical 
kyphosis after CLP may cause insufficient decompression of the spinal cord. 
Thus, prevention of cervical kyphosis after CLP and identification of its risk 
factors are essential.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between preoperative 
cervical foraminal stenosis and kyphotic changes after CLP.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: We reviewed 108 patients who underwent CLP for cervical 
myelopathy between May 2014 and May 2019 and who were followed up for at least 
24 months.
OUTCOME MEASURES: For clinical assessments, neck pain, arm pain, neck disability 
index, Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, EuroQol 5-Dimension, and 
subjective improvement rate reported by the patients were evaluated. For 
radiologic parameters, C2-7 Cobb lordotic angle (CLA), C2-7 sagittal vertical 
axis, T1 slope (TS), TS minus CLA (TS-CLA), and cervical range of motion were 
assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for 24 months. Cervical foraminal 
stenosis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.
METHODS: The study population was divided into the kyphosis group (n = 25 
patients) and the lordosis group (n = 83 patients) according to the CLA at 24 
months postoperatively. Preoperative risk factors related to postoperative 
kyphosis were analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed using independent 
two-sample t test, Chi-square test, logistic regression analysis, and linear 
mixed model.
RESULTS: Preoperative foraminal stenosis, CLA, TS, and TS-CLA were significantly 
different between the kyphosis and lordosis groups. In multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, foraminal stenosis (odds ratio [OR], 4.471; p = .0242) 
significantly increased the risk of kyphosis. The probability of developing 
kyphosis decreased with an increase in the CLA (OR, 0.840; p = .0001), while the 
probability of developing kyphosis increased with an increase in the TS-CLA (OR, 
1.104; p = .0044).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative cervical foraminal stenosis is an independent risk 
factor for cervical kyphosis following CLP. Thus, CLP may not be a suitable 
surgical option for cervical myelopathy combined with foraminal stenosis.
